Eviolite is the item of choice on almost every set, effectively giving Bisharp the bulk of a fully-evolved physical tank and letting it survive neutral Earthquakes, Heat Waves, and Dazzling Gleams that would otherwise OHKO it. The two most common spreads illustrate two philosophies: the 252/252 Adamant set maximizes immediate power and guarantees KOs on frail threats like Flutter Mane or Tornadus after a Defiant boost, while the 60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe spread hits 91 Speed\u2014enough to outrun uninvested base 70s and most support Pok\u00e9mon\u2014while still preserving respectable bulk. Iron Head is the mandatory Steel STAB, flinching opposing Fairies and punishing Xerneas and Sylveon switch-ins. Sucker Punch gives Bisharp a +1 priority option that, after a Defiant boost, cleanly KOes Dragapult, Calyrex-S, and other faster threats. Assurance is the sleeper pick: under doubles field conditions it becomes a 120-Base Power Dark move that deletes Psychic- and Ghost-types expecting to survive a Sucker Punch. Protect is non-negotiable for scouting choice-locked moves, stalling Dynamax turns, and enabling partner set-up or speed control. Tera Ghost removes Bisharp\u2019s sole Fighting weakness, letting it survive Close Combat from Iron Hands or Sacred Sword from Zamazenta, whereas Tera Dark boosts both Sucker Punch and Assurance into nuke-tier damage while preserving the Dark typing\u2019s useful Psychic immunity.</OUTPUT>"

In Trick Room squads it can operate as a secondary attacker that still functions outside reverse speed control thanks to Sucker Punch, while in Gothitelle shells it appreciates Fake Out or Follow Me support to buy a free turn for Protect or Sucker Punch mind-games.

In best-of-three VGC this is invaluable: lead Dugtiro next to a setup sweeper such as Calm Mind Armarouge or Swords Dance Gallade, trap the slower threat, KO or cripple it, and grant your partner a free turn to boost. 110 base Speed with a Jolly nature outpaces the crowded 100/95 tier (Garchomp, Lando-T, Meowscarada) and lets it underspeed its own partner for spread-move synergy. Earthquake is the obligatory STAB, 2HKOing most neutral targets and OHKOing Toxapex, Heatran and Gholdengo after chip. Sucker Punch patches up its mediocre Attack by giving it a 70 BP priority move that punishes faster threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao. Stomping Tantrum offers a second Ground STAB that doesn\u2019t hit your ally, crucial for doubles, while also doubling power if the previous move failed\u2014ideal after a predicted Protect. Endeavor is the set\u2019s ace: after Focus Sash pops, Dugtrio drops a 400-HP Kyogre to 1, letting any teammate finish it off. EV spreads are straightforward: max Speed to trap as much of the metagame as possible, max Attack to secure KOs, and the remaining 4 EVs are split between HP and Defense to slightly manipulate download and Gyro Ball damage. Ghost Tera removes Normal- and Fighting-type weaknesses, blocks priority, and turns Earthquake into a neutral hit against Corviknight and Skarmory. Fairy Tera instead offers a Dragon immunity and a valuable resistance to Dark and Bug, notably letting it survive Kingambit\u2019s Sucker Punch and retaliate.

Water Pulse becomes a pseudo-Hydro Pump with perfect accuracy, Dark Pulse grants reliable flinch chances against slower threats, Aura Sphere hits Steel and Normal types for clean damage, and Dragon Pulse rounds out coverage against opposing Dragons. The Modest 252/252 spread maximizes this damage output, but leaves Clawitzer at a mere base 59 Speed, meaning it will usually move after many common threats. Tera Grass is preferred to flip Rotom-Wash, Miraidon, and Rillaboom matchups, turning Clawitzer\u2019s Water weakness into a resistance and allowing it to tank Grassy Glides or Thunderbolts that would otherwise KO. Life Orb is the dominant item, giving every attack a noticeable bump without locking Clawitzer into a choice, preserving flexibility in doubles where target selection is crucial. The Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s weaknesses are its middling bulk and low Speed; it needs either Tailwind or rain support to function optimally, and even then it must be positioned carefully to avoid taking heavy damage before it can attack.</OUTPUT>"

Protect is mandatory both to stall Dynamax turns and to scout choice-locked or priority moves that could pick off the penguin before it drums. Despite its terrifying damage output, Eiscue is a one-trick pony: if hail ends, if the opponent carries special attackers, or if Eiscue is forced to take a second hit before setting up, it folds immediately.

Snipe Shot\u2019s innate high critical-hit ratio plus Scope Lens yields a 50 % crit chance, meaning roughly half of its attacks will ignore enemy boosts and screens and deal nuclear damage. Icy Wind provides immediate speed control that benefits slower sweepers such as Kingambit and Rillaboom, while Taunt shuts down Trick Room, Recover, and Tailwind attempts from the likes of Indeedee, Dondozo, and Murkrow. Focus Sash variants guarantee at least one attack or disruption move against faster leads or double-target scenarios, whereas Life Orb boosts every roll at the cost of chip. Terastallizing into Water turns Snipe Shot into a 120 BP critical nuke that can OHKO neutral targets like Gholdengo and Chien-Pao after minimal chip, while Ice Tera gives a 140 BP Max Hailstorm that deletes Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and Dragon-types at the cost of a more exploitable defensive typing. Inteleon\u2019s main drawbacks are its mediocre bulk and reliance on critical variance; any team that can survive the first turn or redirect its attacks can punish it with priority or spread moves. Nonetheless, its ability to compress offensive pressure, speed control, and disruption into one slot makes it a premier lead or late-game cleaner on hyper-offensive and tempo squads.</OUTPUT>"

Sand Stream immediately chips every non-Steel/Ground/Rock for 6% per turn, breaking Focus Sashes and turning 2HKOs into 3HKOs for its partners.

Sand Tomb traps opposing Tera Fairy or Tera Flying sweepers that try to dodge Earthquake, ensuring sand remains up and preventing them from freely pivoting. Slack Off grants longevity that most weather setters lack, letting Hippowdon win long games against other balance or hard-TR squads. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn, Fake Out, and Sucker Punch users, stacking with sand to rack 18% on contact moves, while Leftovers variants prefer gradual recovery to stay above 50% for consistent Yawn cycles. Tera Dragon removes the Grass weakness and grants neutrality to Water, while Tera Steel gives key resistances to Ice and Fairy and makes Hippowdon a Poison-immune pivot that can safely switch into Glimmora\u2019s Mortal Spin.

The item split between Choice Scarf (\u224849 %) and Focus Sash (\u224817 %) defines two distinct roles: Scarf variants act as the fastest Parting Shot user in the format, capable of neutering threats like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon or Swords Dance Kingambit before they move, while Sash variants trade immediate speed for longevity, guaranteeing at least one Parting Shot or Taunt versus faster Scarfers or priority-heavy teams. Tera-Ghost is used on almost 90 % of sets, removing Fake Out and First Impression weaknesses while granting invaluable immunities to Fighting and Normal, letting Persian block Extreme Speed, Rage Fist boosts and Indeedee\u2019s Expanding Force. Foul Play is the sole attack, punishing physical set-up sweepers and Intimidate users for their own investment, while Switcheroo cripples slow walls like Dondozo or Ting-Lu by locking them into a single move or stripping their Leftovers. Taunt completes the disruption suite, preventing Trick Room, Tailwind or recovery moves from ever going up.</OUTPUT>"

Eviolite patches its paper-thin bulk to the point where it can survive a non-boosted Jet Punch from Bundle or a Sucker Punch from Kingambit, retaliate with a STAB, Adaptability-boosted First Impression (effectively 180 BP after STAB), and finish with Earthquake if needed. Feint is invaluable in VGC 2024\u2019s Protect-heavy metagame, denying opposing Protects so rain partners such as Kingdra or Kilowattrel can secure KOs, or allowing Armarouge to blow through Wide Guard. The chosen Tera Water removes the Grass weakness and turns Trapinch into an emergency rain check, letting it survive Surging Strikes or Leaf Blades and retaliate. The EV spreads show two philosophies: Brave 252/252 maximizes immediate power for guaranteed OHKOs on 4 HP Rotom-W and standard Kingambit, while Sassy 252/0/132/0/124/0 preserves Trick Room speed tier, shores up special bulk to survive Modest Armarouge Heat Waves, and still secures the same crucial KOs after a bit of chip.

Medicham itself is no slouch: even uninvested, its doubled Attack reaches ~260, meaning a STAB Close Combat cleanly 2HKOes most Incineroar and bulky Rotom variants. Psychic Cut punts Amoonguss and Toxapex while avoiding Intimidate drops. The preferred spread is Adamant 252/252 to maximise immediate power and Speed-tie positive-nature base 80s after Scarf, but a Jolly 236 variant creeps neutral-nature base 100s such as Chien-Pao and Jolly Kilowattrel. Tera Fighting turns Close Combat into a nuke that deletes even resisted targets after prior damage, while Tera Steel grants a clutch Toxic immunity and a Fairy resistance, letting Medicham survive Sylveon Hyper Voice or Mimikhu Play Rough and fire back.

Water Absorb variants completely blank Rain archetypes: Kyogre\u2019s Origin Pulse becomes free recovery, while Palafin\u2019s Jet Punch fails to break Lapras\u2019s 352 HP / 219 SpD Calm bulk. Freeze-Dry is the crux of the set: it 2HKOs every relevant Water/Ground (except Clodsire) and guarantees the OHKO on Amoonguss after Tera Fire chip, solving what would otherwise be a full-stop to Perish Song. Chilling Water provides consistent speed control, dropping threats like Chien-Pao or Bundle to -1 so that Lapras can either Protect stall or let a slower partner like Garganacl move last to set Salt Cure. Protect is mandatory for Perish loops: on turn 3 Lapras Protects while the partner pivots out via U-turn or a switching move, denying the KO and resetting the board. The listed EV spreads are optimised for common benchmarks: Calm 252/188/68 survives +1 Fluter Mane Moonblast 100% of the time and lives Life Orb Iron Bundle Freeze-Dry, while Modest 244/236 guarantees the 2HKO on max SpD Toxapex and has a 43% chance to OHKO 0 HP Tornadus after Chilling Water chip. Tera Fire is chosen on 23% of teams to remove Grass weakness and gain a crucial Fake Out immunity versus Incineroar, turning many 2v2 endgames into autowins once Sun or Grass types are eliminated.

Dark-types are the biggest obstacle: Kingambit survives even banded Dynamic Punch and retaliates with 4\u00d7 Iron Head, while Chien-Pao outspeeds outside room and cleanly OHKOs with Crunch.  Ghost mirrors favour Golurk if it lands the first Poltergeist, but Aegislash and bulky Gholdengo can live one hit and KO back with Shadow Ball.  Into Tailroom mirrors Golurk can serve as an anti-room piece: it underspeeds most setters and can KO Indeedee-F before Psychic Terrain goes up, or break Dusclops after Tera.  Against hyper-offence, confusion fishing can flip games: banded Dynamic Punch into Tera Fighting has a 50% chance to neuter a booster such as Dragonite or Palafin, letting a partner clean up.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Alcremie\u2019s calling card is Decorate, a +2 boost to both offensive stats of any ally, making it the only Pok\u00e9mon in the format that can instantly convert passive board states into lethal ones without requiring a turn of setup. The listed Bold spread (252 HP / 200 Def / 52 SpD) survives key physical rolls such as Choice Band Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and Iron Valiant Spirit Break while still tanking modest special hits like Specs Dragapult Shadow Ball. Aroma Veil is preferred on most teams because it shuts down Prankster Taunt from Whimsicott, Murkrow, and Grimmsnarl, as well as Encore from Dondozo and Toxapex, guaranteeing that Alcremie can execute its game plan. Sweet Veil is a niche option to block sleep from Amoonguss or Spore from Breloom, but the value of Aroma Veil against the dominant Prankster meta is usually higher. Light Screen is chosen over Reflect because most of Alcremie\u2019s best partners (Sneasler, Volcarona, Hydreigon) are special attackers that appreciate the special bulk more than physical bulk, and the 5-turn screen lets them set up or rip through teams after a Decorate. Dazzling Gleam is a mandatory two-target STAB that prevents Alcremie from being complete Taunt bait and picks off weakened Dragons, Dark-types, and Fighting-types. Protect is obvious for pivoting and stalling out Dynamax turns or Tailwind timers. Tera Water is the standout Tera type: it removes the Fire weakness that plagues Steel-tera variants, keeps a neutral hit into Steel-types, and lets Alcremie survive Heat Wave from Tornadus or Volcarona and Iron Head from Garchomp. Tera Fairy is an alternative that strengthens Dazzling Gleam and grants a Dragon immunity, but the defensive value of Tera Water is generally preferred. Leftovers is the only item worth considering because Alcremie\u2019s job is to stay on the field for multiple turns, either to Decorate twice or to Decorate and then screen; Sitrus Berry is too small a recovery and Babiri Berry is too matchup-specific. EV spreads can be tweaked: 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD with a Calm nature lets Alcremie survive Specs Hydreigon Draco Meteor and +2 Espathra Tera Fighting Tera Blast, but the Bold spread is the most common on ladder because it handles the physical meta better. In best-of-three, Alcremie is usually brought in game-two or game-three when the opponent has revealed less Fake Out or Taunt pressure, and it pairs beautifully with Dynamax partners because the Decorate boost applies to Max Moves, turning Max Airstream or Max Ooze into even bigger snowballs.</OUTPUT>"

Terrain teams with Indeedee can block Fake Out but also block Alcremie\u2019s own priority, so positioning is key.

Milotic is a niche pick that benefits from Decorate turning Scald into a 2HKO on even bulky Toxapex while gaining +1 Defense from Competitive if the opponent tries to Intimidate it.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Barraskewda\u2019s claim to fame is its astronomical 136 base Speed, which under Swift Swim and rain becomes effectively unmatched in the current Regulation G format. This allows it to function as both a late-game cleaner and a powerful mid-game wallbreaker depending on item choice. Choice Band sets are the most threatening, turning Liquidation into a 140 BP nuke that OHKOes most neutral targets and 2HKOes even bulky resists such as AV Incineroar and Corviknight after Stealth Rock-style chip. Close Combat nails Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and opposing Incineroar, while Flip Turn preserves momentum versus predicted switches or Protects. Protect occupies the fourth slot on virtually every set, letting it scout choice-locked foes and block Fake Out damage that would otherwise break its Focus Sash variant. The Sash variant trades immediate power for survivability, guaranteeing at least one attack or pivot versus faster scarfers or priority spam teams. Propeller Tail is a niche ability that ignores redirection, but the overwhelming dominance of rain archetypes means Swift Swim is chosen roughly 70 % of the time. Tera Water is the default for the extra Liquidation damage and a stronger Flip Turn, but Tera Ghost is gaining traction to blank Extreme Speed from Dragonite, ignore Fake Out, and block Prankster Twave from Grimmsnarl. The listed teammates form a cohesive rain core: Pelipper sets infinite rain and provides wide-gauge support via Tailwind and Wider Lens Hurricanes; Incineroar offers Fake Out, Intimidate, and Parting Shot to create free turns; Ursaluna-Bloodmoon appreciates the removal of Water-immune foes and breaks past special walls that Barraskewda baits; Dragapult forms a fast Ghost spam core, punishing opposing priority with its own Tera Ghost synergy; Weezing neutralises Fairy and Grass threats with Neutralizing Gas and Sludge Bomb poisons; Corviknight supplies Defog, slow U-turns, and a crucial Ground immunity that covers Pelipper. In practice Barraskewda functions as the speed control glue that lets rain teams apply immediate pressure without requiring setup turns, distinguishing it from more passive Swift Swim sweepers like Kingdra.</OUTPUT>"

Trick Room is the worst matchup: base 136 Speed is irrelevant, and Hatterene or Indeedee-F can set Room while surviving a Liquidation.

Chlorophyll turns it into a 398-Speed monster under sun, letting it fire un-missable Sleep Powders before most opposing support Pok\u00e9mon can even click Protect, and its 90 base Special Attack is still enough to OHKO common threats like Gholdengo with +1 Tera Grass Leaf Storm or cleanly 2HKO bulky Waters with Pollen Puff into a partner. After You is the signature tech: it allows a sun partner\u2014usually a -Speed Torkoal\u2014to move immediately after Lilligant, effectively giving the sun setter a free turn to Eruption or set sun again, or lets Volcarona fire a +1 Heat Wave before opposing Tailwind or Trick Room can be completed. Protect is mandatory for double-target mind-games and to preserve Focus Sash, while Pollen Puff provides 50% healing to any ally, punishing spread-damage teams and offsetting Flare Blitz recoil or Life Orb chip. Tera choices are calculated: Water removes the Fire weakness and combos with sun to survive Heat Wave mirrors; Fire boosts Eruption synergy and flips the script on Corviknight and Amoonguss; Grass grants a reliable STAB Leaf Storm nuke; Ghost blocks Fake Out and ExtremeSpeed, giving Lilligant a one-time slot to survive and keep the support loop alive. Lilligant\u2019s EV spreads reflect two philosophies: max/max Timid guarantees the speed tie against opposing Chlorophyll users and +1 Iron Bundle, while the 140 HP / 116 Def spread survives Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and Modest Torkoal Overheat in sun, letting it remain on the field as a long-term nuisance. The combination of speed, disruption, and team healing makes Lilligant one of the most efficient support Pok\u00e9mon in sun structures, and its mere presence forces opponents to respect both the sleep and the After You threat every single turn.</OUTPUT>"

Opposing sun or rain teams that carry their own weather setter can flip the speed tier: a opposing Chlorophyll Venusaur or Swift Swim Barraskeweda will outspeed and OHKO with Sludge Bomb or Liquidation before Lilligant can respond. Trick Room turns its greatest asset into a liability; once room is up, Lilligat becomes the slowest Pok\u00e9mon on the field and is easily picked off by Rhyperior or Hatterene.

This creates explosive swing turns when paired with setup sweepers such as Volcarona or Quaquaval, letting Oricorio double-dip on momentum while still attacking. Revelation Dance becomes an Electric-type attack thanks to Pom-Pom\u2019s form, giving it a reliable 90 BP STAB that never misses and bypasses abilities like Flash Fire or Volt Absorb. Air Slash supplies a secondary Flying STAB with a coveted 30 % flinch chance, letting it fish for extra utility against slower targets. Icy Wind offers both damage and speed control, allowing Oricorio to underspeed and then outpace threats after the drop, while Protect is mandatory in doubles to shield against double-targets and stall out opposing speed control or Dynamon turns. The EV spread maxes Special Attack, dumps 132 into offense, and outspeeds key benchmarks like neutral-nature base 100s at 124 EVs, while the remaining EVs bulk the HP for better Sitrus Berry or Focus Sash synergy. Tera Fairy is the most popular option, granting a Dragon immunity and a useful resistance to Dark and Fighting, though Tera Steel provides an omniresist slot against Rock and Ice, and Tera Ice amplifies Icy Wind damage while giving a strong offensive presence against Lando-T and Amoonguss. Items are split between Sitrus Berry for longevity, Life Orb for damage, Focus Sash for one-time survival, and Covert Cloak to shrug off spore or static, indicating a flexible role that can be tuned to the team\u2019s needs.</OUTPUT>"

Helping Hand rounds out the set, letting Sceptile boost a partner\u2019s damage by 50% on any given turn, which is especially potent with rain-boosted Surging Strikes from Basculegion or Archaludon\u2019s Electro Shot.

Regenerator is the icing on the cake: after Cyclizar has passed the Substitute it can simply switch out later in the match and regain a third of its health, letting it act multiple times per game. Covert Cloak is the preferred item because it nullifies Fake Out, Rock Slide flinches, and Nuzzle paralysis, ensuring Cyclizar can fire off Shed Tail even under heavy disruption; Leftovers and Sitrus Berry are workable alternatives if you value passive recovery or a one-time burst. Draco Meteor is the only attack you need: it 2HKOs most neutral targets and detours Landorus-T and Garchomp from trying to set up on you.

Ice Spinner provides a secondary STAB that destroys Garchomp, Landorus-T and Amoonguss while removing opposing Psychic Terrain that could block priority support. Tera Water is preferred on the sweeping set because it halves incoming Fire damage, removes the crippling Stealth Rock weakness, and synergizes with the ubiquitous rain teams that often accompany hail cores. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that grants an Electric immunity and makes High Horsepower even stronger, but the loss of Fire resistance is noticeable versus Incineroar or Heatran. Loaded Dice turns Icicle Spear into a 125 BP spread move that can devastate frail doubles leads, yet the opportunity cost of not carrying Protect or a healing item is high. Sheer Force is occasionally run to boost Ice Spinner and High Horsepower, but the speed granted by Slush Rush under hail is the primary reason to use Cetitan over other bulky breakers such as Azumarill or Iron Hands. Thick Fat deserves a brief mention on Assault Vest sets that aim to check Chien-Pao and Iron Valiant, but the drop in power is palpable.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Magnezone\u2019s niche in VGC 2025 is defined by its ability to compress offensive pressure and pivoting into one slot, something few other Steel-types can claim. Sturdy is the most common ability at 70 % usage, guaranteeing at least one hit or screen against faster leads, while Analytic (37 %) rewards slow Volt Switches and late-game cleanup, and Magnet Pull (54 %) can trap and remove opposing Corviknight or Togekiss if prediction is on point. Choice Specs variants are the default, turning Thunderbolt into a 120-base STAB nuke that OHKOes most neutral targets and 2HKOes even bulky resists like Rotom-Wash. Flash Cannon provides reliable Steel coverage that punishes Fairy- and Ice-type Dynamax targets, while Tera Blast becomes either a 100 % accurate Flying move post-Tera or a Ground move to snipe opposing Magnezone and Toxtricity. Volt Switch is the glue that lets Magnezone maintain offensive tempo, bringing in frail attackers like Ursaluna or Rillaboom safely after a KO or chip damage. Light Clay sets sacrifice immediate power for 8-turn dual screens, enabling hyper-offense teammates such as Swords Dance Rillaboom or Belly Drum Ursaluna to set up with impunity. The Modest nature and 252/252 spread are non-negotiable for Specs sets to secure benchmarks like OHKOing max-HP Togekiss with Thunderbolt and 2HKOing Assault Vest Gholdengo. Relaxed nature and 252 HP / 252 Def are used exclusively with Light Clay to survive Earthquakes from Landorus-T and Garchomp while setting Reflect first turn. Tera Flying is the dominant choice because it removes the Ground weakness, synergizes with Grassy Glide Rillaboom and Tailwind Togekiss, and allows Magnezone to spam Volt Switch without fear of Earth Power or Earthquake. Tera Ground is a tech option that flips the Electric immunity, letting Magnezone win mirror matchups and surprise KO opposing Toxtricity and opposing Magnezone. Teammates are chosen to cover Magnezone\u2019s poor Speed tier and limited coverage: Ursaluna provides Fake Out and priority Ground damage, Rillaboom sets Grassy Terrain and breaks Water-types, Alolan Ninetales offers Aurora Veil and Freeze-Dry for Dragons, Porygon2 gives Trick Room control, Torkoal supplies sun-boosted Eruption and removes opposing weather, and Dusclops offers Trick Room and Ally Switch support for the bulky screen variant.</OUTPUT>"

Against Tailwind or Regieleki hyper-offense, Sturdy guarantees at least one screen or a heavy trade, while Specs Thunderbolt picks off non-Dynamax variants of Zapdos and Yveltal. Versus Trick Room, Magnezone must either drop a screen on turn 1 or Dynamax immediately to survive Rhyperior\u2019s Earthquake or Torkoal\u2019s Eruption; Tera Flying is essential here to avoid the OHKO. Against sun teams, Magnezone outslows Torkoal under Trick Room but risks a sun-boosted Heat Wave, so pairing it with Rillaboom to overwrite sun with Grassy Terrain is critical. Mirror matchups hinge on Tera type: Tera Ground variants beat Tera Flying variants one-on-one, but both lose if Sturdy has been broken. Rain teams present a mixed bag: Specs Thunderbolt 2HKOes Pelipper through Sitrus Berry, but Swampert under rain OHKOes back with Earthquake unless Magnezone has already Terastallized to Flying. Finally, vs. stall or Corviknight cores, Magnet Pull variants can trap and remove Corviknight with Volt Switch + Tera Blast Ground, but must watch for Dynamax and Shed Shell variants.</OUTPUT>"

STAB Thunderbolt and Discharge give it perfect neutral coverage alongside Blizzard; Discharge is preferred in doubles to fish for para-spread while still chunking Corviknight and bulky Waters.  Volt Switch lets it maintain offensive momentum and escape from the dangerous Dragons it baits in, while also forming a slow VoltTurn core with Incineroar.  Levitate is irreplaceable\u2014turning the usual Rotom-Wash Ground weakness into an immunity\u2014so it can safely switch into Earthquakes from Garchomp or Lando and immediately threaten back.  Tera Electric is the only realistic option: it boosts both STABs, makes Volt Switch hit harder, and removes the Ice typing\u2019s Stealth Rock weakness in BO3.  The EV spread is pure max/max Modest because the extra power is essential to secure KOs on 252/0 Garchomp and 252/0 Dragonite after hail damage.  Rotom-Frost\u2019s shortcomings are equally stark: 86 base Speed is a hair below the crowded 90-95 tier, meaning it loses the mirror to Rotom-Wash and is outsped by +1 Dragonite, while 50/107/107 bulk is merely okay, leaving it vulnerable to strong neutral hits such as Specs Dragapult\u2019s Draco or Life Orb Chomp\u2019s Tera Dragon Outrage.  It is also a four-moveslot mon: without Protect it hates Fake Out and priority, and without Will-O-Wisp it can\u2019t cripple physical set-up sweepers.  Finally, it is completely dependent on hail; if Ninetales is KOed or if the opponent sets sun, Rotom-Frost\u2019s accuracy and damage output plummet.  In practice it functions as a hit-and-run breaker that removes or heavily dents the opponent\u2019s Grounds and Dragons so teammates such as Annihilape, Garchomp, or Talonflame can clean late-game.</OUTPUT>"

The prevalence of Focus Sash (\u224871 %) shows players value the guaranteed one-time survival to get both Tailwind and a Hypnosis attempt; Eviolite (\u224828 %) is preferred on bulkier variants that aim to pivot repeatedly with Protect and Screech, stripping 2 stages of Defense so partners such as Kingambit or Garchomp can secure OHKOs without committing Tera or Dynamax.

Water Absorb turns the abundant Water-type attacks of the format into free recovery, synergizing with rain cores built around Kingdra and Politoed. Unaware, though less common, blanks Dragon Dance Dragonite and Bulk Up Palafin, making Clodsire one of the few stopgaps that doesn\u2019t care about opposing stat boosts. Yawn is the centerpiece move: a non-damaging, non-priority forced switch that can neutralize a Dynamax or deny a Trick Room setter. Toxic Spikes punishes those switches, piling residual damage on bulky Waters and Fairies that plague rain teams. High Horsepower rounds the set by 2HKOing Gholdengo and Toxapex while avoiding Wide Guard. Protect is mandatory in doubles to stall Yawn turns, scout choice locks, and gain Leftovers/Sludge recovery. Tera Normal removes Clodsire\u2019s Ground weakness and grants a crucial Ghost immunity, letting it Yawn on Aegislash or Ghost-type Dragapult without fear of Shadow Ball. Tera Dark is preferred on teams that already pack Wide Guard or Tera Normal support elsewhere, as it resists both of Dragapult\u2019s STABs and provides a Dark resist for Kingdra.

Tera Water flips the Fire and Ground match-ups for a single turn, letting it survive Heat Wave or Earthquake and guarantee the second Trick Room. Tera Poison is the safest STAB boost and blocks enemy Toxic, while Tera Dark provides a crucial Ghost resistance and punishes Indeedee-F mirror wars. Move slots are rigid: Trick Room is mandatory, Protect guarantees Leftovers and partner positioning, Sludge Bomb pressures Fairies and Grass-types, and Expanding Force is the spread option once Psychic Terrain is live. The result is a setter that can\u2019t be ignored offensively yet is bulky enough to trade repeatedly thanks to Regenerator.</OUTPUT>"

Hyper Beam is almost exclusively a Tera Normal nuke that deletes weakened Dynamax or Terra'd threats, but leaves Pyroar helpless next turn. Timid 252/252 spread is non-negotiable to speed-tie opposing base 100s and outrun Jolly Chien-Pao; the remaining 4 EVs are dumped in HP to slightly improve bulk. Unnerve is the preferred ability because denying Sitrus or Chesto Berry can flip mirror matchups versus Ting-Lu or Iron Hands, while Rivalry is a marginal damage increase only versus same-gendered foes.

The bear fits best on dedicated Trick Room squads that can keep the field up for two to three turns, and its four-moveslot syndrome means it almost always runs the same four attacks, making it predictable but brutally efficient.</OUTPUT>"

The two most common spreads are max/max Brave for pure power and a bulkier Adamant 228/252/28 spread that lives Choice Band Chien-Pao Ice Spinner after Tera Grass. Ice/Fighting is historically an awkward defensive typing, but in the current meta it nails the omnipresent Dragon, Flying, Grass and Steel cores while only fearing the rare Psychic or Fairy move. Tera Grass is the standout Tera type, removing the Water weakness and giving Crabominable a crucial resistance to Rillish-Grassy Glide and Kingambit\u2019s Sacred Sword. Tera Water is next, turning the Fire and Water matchups on their head and letting Crabominable stay in on Heatran or Volcanion and retaliate with Crabhammer. The choice of ability is surprisingly impactful: Hyper Cutter blocks Incineroar and Landorus-T intimidate cycles, preserving its two-shot damage tier, while Iron Fist pushes Ice Hammer into guaranteed OHKO territory on 252 HP Dragonite through Tera Normal. Anger Point is essentially a meme, but in best-of-one it can steal games if Crabominable survives a critical hit. Four attacks is non-negotiable\u2014Crabhammer and Ice Hammer are the most powerful reliable STABs in the format, Close Combat is mandatory for Steels, and Upper Hand is the best way to finish off weakened faster threats while gaining priority under Trick Room. Assault Vest sets trade a chunk of power for the ability to survive two hits from special attackers like Iron Moth or Choice Specs Dragapult, but the 30% damage loss is usually not worth the drop in KOs.</OUTPUT>"

The Eviolite investment allows Primeape to survive super-effective hits from the likes of Life Orb Gholdengo Make It Rain or Choice Specs Hydreigon Draco Meteor, retaliate, and recover significant HP, making it a self-sufficient win-condition on teams that lack traditional recovery. In endgame scenarios a +4 or +6 Rage Fist can muscle past even resisted targets, giving Primeape genuine cleanup potential.</OUTPUT>"

This allows Icy Wind to drop the opposing side\u2019s Speed before they move, creating a two-stage swing that turns slower breakers like Archaludon or Basculegion into immediate threats. Shadow Ball provides a 120-base-power STAB option after Tera Ice, 2HKOing offensive Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and opposing Froslass while also sniping 4 HP Tornadus. Destiny Bond is the terror factor: because Focus Sash guarantees survival of any one attack, Froslass can click Destiny Bond on the same turn a dynamaxed opponent attacks, forcing a double-down dilemma\u2014either they KO Froslass and lose their Dynamax, or they switch and sacrifice momentum. Protect is mandatory for scouting, wasting Tailwind or Trick Room turns, and enabling partner set-up. Cursed Body adds a 30 % chance to disable the move that hit Froslass, occasionally stranding a restricted legendary with only one usable attack. Snow Cloaf variants exist to abuse hail, but hail is almost non-existent in current Regulation G, so Cursed Body\u2019s utility outweighs the evasion gamble. Tera Ice is the most straightforward: it strengthens both STABs, turns Shadow Ball into a legitimate nuke, and grants a neutrality to common Steel-type moves. Tera Fairy removes the Dark weakness, letting Froslass survive Kingambit\u2019s Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Tera Fairy Tera-boosted Shadow Ball.

Modest nature with 182 HP / 74 Def / 252 SpA (or the bulkier 132/200/132 variant) lets it survive powerful physical hits such as Life Orb Chien-Pao Ice Spinner while still OHKOing 4 HP Flutter Mane with Sludge Bomb after Tera Poison. Assault Vest variants reach 615 effective special bulk after the boost, allowing them to stomach Specs Tatsugiri Hydro Pump or Choice Specs Pelipper Hurricane and retaliate with Thunderbolt from a teammate or its own neutral Dragon Pulse. Leftovers sets trade immediate bulk for passive recovery, pairing well with Protect stalling and Covert Cloak to ignore fake-out or secondary effect spam. Sap Sipper is the clear ability of choice: switching into Rillaboom Grassy Glide or Amoonguss Spore nets a +1 Attack boost that turns Goodra into a surprise physical breaker, letting its uninvested Body Slam or Power Whip 2HKO common special walls such as Blissey. Hydration is usable only on dedicated rain teams, curing status at the end of each turn and letting Goodra run Resto-Chesto or Hydration-Rest loops, but such builds are rare. Gooey punishes U-turn and Fake Out users, but the speed drops rarely swing games compared to the immediate value of Sap Sipper. Tera Water removes the Ice and Fairy weaknesses, granting a crucial neutrality to Freeze-Dry and turning Goodra into a pseudo-water tank that can spam rain-boosted Surf or retaliate with Tera Blast Ice. Tera Poison grants a Fairy resistance and an invaluable Toxic immunity, letting Goodra beat Togekiss, Sylveon, and Hatterene one-on-one while also flipping the Iron Moth matchup. Goodra\u2019s main niche is therefore as a flexible mid-speed pivot that compresses special bulk, Dragon-type offensive presence, and Sap Sipper utility into one slot.</OUTPUT>"

Ice-types such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur outspeed and threaten with Ice Spinner or Icicle Crash, but the bulky spread survives Jolly Life Orb Ice Spinner from full and can retaliate with Tera Water Surf or Dragon Pulse. Dragon mirror matchups revolve around speed and Tera: Goodra loses to Specs Dialga or Modest Hydreigon but beats physically offensive Dragons like Roaring Moon after Tera Poison. Fire-types such as Chi-Yu and Torkoal dislike Surf and are outsped, while Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo fear Tera Water Surf or Fire coverage from teammates. Grass-types are outright countered by Sap Sipper, turning their STAB into set-up fodder. Amoonguss is perhaps the most important matchup: Assault Vest Goodra avoids the 2HKO from Pollen Puff and can either Sludge Bomb for the KO or click Protect to waste Spore turns, while Sap Sipper variants gain +1 Attack every time they switch in. Overall, Goodra\u2019s matchups are neutral to favorable against most special attackers and Grass-types, but it must Terastallize to escape the common Ice and Fairy killers.</OUTPUT>"

Sap Sipper gives it a secondary role as a Grass-type deterrent, puniting Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Lilligant while simultaneously boosting its otherwise unused Attack stat.

Sludge Bomb hits Fairies and Grass-types for super-effective damage while also spreading poison to bulkier walls such as Dondozo and Toxapex. Surf provides spread damage that is boosted by rain and benefits from Tera Water, while also hitting Fire- and Rock-types that otherwise wall Goodra. Assault Vest sets sacrifice flexibility for raw special bulk, whereas Leftovers sets can run Protect and Covert Cloak to ignore fake-out and status, making them better long-term win conditions.

Stealth Rock is surprisingly viable in best-of-three formats where opponents rely on Focus Sash Gholdengo, Dragonite or Chien-Pao; chip from rocks plus Flash Cannon puts them in guaranteed KO range the following turn. The Assault Vest set trades Protect for immediate power and the freedom to run four attacks, pairing well with speed control from Icy Wind Milotic or Tailwind Dragapult. Overall, Duraludon demands respect at team preview because it removes the safety net of redirection while still hitting like a truck.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Electivire\u2019s value in VGC 2024 Regulation G lies in its ability to compress redirection and speed control into one slot while offering a Motor Drive carrot that lures Thunder Waves and Volt Switches. Base 95 Speed with a Jolly nature and full EVs hits 317, outspeeding Lilligant, Armarouge under sun, and every neutral-natured base-100 such as Garchomp and Zapdos. 104 HP plus Sitrus gives it a 20% berry range that almost always activates after one Wild Charge recoil or a modest super-effective hit, letting it survive long enough to redirect twice. 52 Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on standard Torkoal with Earthquake after spread damage, while the remaining EVs are dumped into bulk. Motor Drive is preferred on teams that already pack sun or Psychic Terrain, because the +1 Speed immediately turns Electivire into a fast Follow Me user that can still outspeed threats the following turn even if it switches out. Vital Spirit is a serviceable alternative against Amoonguss or sleep-centric teams, but the data show players overwhelmingly prefer the burst speed option. The move suite is intentionally narrow: Protect and Follow Me are mandatory for redirection pivoting, Wild Charge is the hardest-hitting physical STAB available, and Earthquake is the best coverage move that also exploits Torkoal\u2019s weakness while not harming Flying- or Levitate partners. Tera Flying is the most common defensive option, removing the 4\u00d7 Ground weakness and granting an emergency immunity to opposing Earthquakes while still resisting Fighting. Tera Psychic is chosen on teams that already run Indeedee-F or Armarouge, because the terrain boost turns Electivire into a passable special tank that can sponge opposing Expanding Forces and retaliate with its own neutral coverage. The EV spread maximizes speed and minimizes offensive investment because Electivire\u2019s role is to enable teammates, not to sweep; the 52 Attack is merely a breakpoint for KOing Torkoal and for finishing off weakened Rotom-Wash or Heatran. Sitrus Berry is the only item of note, as Leftovers recovery is too slow for doubles and Assault Vest precludes Follow Me. Overall, Electivire is a glue mon that thrives in structured cores where it can turn the opponent\u2019s Electric-type support moves into free speed while keeping frail sweepers safe.</OUTPUT>"

Alternate spreads can shift 52 EVs from Attack to Special Defense to better stomach Indeedee-F\u2019s Expanding Force, but the Tera Psychic variant already handles that. If you need more power, Life Orb can be used, but you forfeit redirection and become extremely frail; such a set should run Thunder Punch over Wild Charge to avoid recoil, but this is niche and not reflected in the usage stats.</OUTPUT>"

Sucker Punch provides invaluable Dark-type priority, letting Lokix pick off faster threats such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu before they move. Leech Life offers a 20 % heal on neutral or super-effective hits, offsetting Life Orb recoil and giving Lokix surprising longevity in longer games. Detect is the mandatory protect move for doubles play, scouting choice items and enabling partner set-up or redirection. The EV spreads show a clear preference for Adamant with 236 Speed to outrun positive-nature base 100s such as Zapdos and Salamence while maximizing Attack; Jolly variants sacrifice a small amount of power to speed-tie opposing Lokix and outspeed +1 Kingdra in rain. Tera Bug is the default, boosting First Impression and Leech Life to ludicrous levels and turning resisted matchups into neutral ones thanks to Tinted Lens. Tera Stellar is a niche option that removes the Bug-typing\u2019s defensive liabilities while preserving STAB on First Impression, useful when facing opposing Bug resists or when Lokix needs to survive a Fire-type move. Safety Goggles variants ignore enemy Rage Powder and Spore, making Lokix a premier Amoonguss answer and allowing it to operate under enemy sand or hail without chip damage. Life Orb remains the most common item, however, because the extra damage is essential for scoring KOs on bulky Dynamax targets like Togekiss and Gastrodon. Lokix\u2019s typing grants it a crucial resistance to Grass, Ground, and Fighting, letting it switch into Rillaboom\u2019s Grassy Glide or Landorus-T\u2019s Earthquake and immediately threaten back.

Against Fire-types such as Heatran and Charizard, Lokix must rely on Sucker Punch or pivot out, as any Fire move is an OHKO even without a boosting item. Flying-types like Togekiss and Corviknight resist both STABs and can retaliate with Heat Wave or Brave Bird, so Lokix needs either a Tera Bug-boosted Leech Life or heavy prior damage to break through. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Lycanroc-Dusk take negligible damage from First Impression and can OHKO with Rock Slide; however, they fear Sucker Punch if already chipped. Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo wall Lokix unless it teras, but they dislike repeated Leech Life cycles that restore Lokix\u2019s health. Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Dragapult are hit neutrally by First Impression and can punish Sucker Punch mind-games with wide-reaching spread moves. In the mirror, speed ties and Sucker Punch calcs decide the exchange, making Jolly Lokix the safer pick. Terrain wars matter: Psychic Terrain blocks Sucker Punch, so Lokix must either target the Indeedee setter first or delay its priority until terrain fades.

Its priority moves let it operate without Tailwind or Trick Room support, freeing teammates to run other forms of speed control or set-up. Tinted Lens turns resisted hits into neutral ones, so Lokix can mindlessly spam First Impression against cores that would normally wall Bug moves, forcing switches and accumulating chip. The Leech Life + Life Orb combo gives it a unique sustain mechanism, allowing Lokix to stay on the field for three or four turns rather than the usual one-and-done suicide lead.

Under Torkoal\u2019s sun it becomes a 252-Speed tier threat that can redirect enemy moves away from the sweepers it supports, then retaliate with 130- or 120-base-power spread moves. The usage data show three clear camps: Modest 252/252 for maximum damage, Timid bulk sets that survive -1 Dragon Darts and Pixilate Hyper Voice, and mid-range Modest spreads that outspeed base 100s after a Moody boost. Moody itself is a niche option\u2014while it can snowball, the randomness and need to stay on field multiple turns clashes with Scovillain\u2019s middling bulk, so Chlorophyll remains the consistent choice. Tera Grass is the most common, removing the Fire weakness and turning Solar Beam into a nuclear STAB; Tera Fire boosts Overheat under sun and flips the script on Amoonguss and Gholdengo; Tera Ghost grants immunity to Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and Parting Shot, letting it block common priority and pivot moves. Covert Cloak is the most popular item, blanking Spore, Nuzzle, and Salt Cure chip; Focus Sash guarantees at least one Rage Powder vs. Flutter Mane or Chien-Pao leads; Choice Specs turns Scovillain into a legitimate wall-breaker that OHKOs bulky Kyogre and Tornadus in sun at the cost of locking into one attack. Spicy Extract is a tech that drops the target\u2019s Defense two stages, enabling physical partners such as Tauros-Paldea-Aqua or Annihilape to secure KOs they would otherwise miss. The Pepper-Grenade\u2019s real drawbacks are its paltry 65/65/55 bulk and a Stealth Rock weakness that forces Heavy-Duty Boots in singles; in doubles, however, it can operate effectively because redirection and spread damage are less punishing and sun teams compress turns by doubling into threats.</OUTPUT>"

Flower Veil is the keystone ability: by preventing stat drops on itself and its partner it blanks Incineroar\u2019s Intimidate, Kingambit\u2019s Supreme Overlord stacks, and random Snarl cycles, allowing sweepers such as Swords Dance Ursaluna-Bloodmoon or Dragon Dance Archaludon to set up without fear.

This stat is maximized in both of its two dominant spreads\u2014Brave 252/252/4 and Relaxed 252/156/100\u2014turning Body Press into a 150-plus BP Fighting move coming off 400-plus Defense. Sturdy is the clear ability of choice (73% usage) because it guarantees Avalugg can always get off at least one attack or support move, making it a premier lead into hyper-offensive dragons, Koraidon, or Chien-Pao stacks. The remaining 28% split between Ice Body and Own Tempo is largely niche: Ice Body can combo with hail set by Torkoal\u2019s UV or Snowscape users to give 1/16 recovery, while Own Tempo prevents confusion from Topsy-Turvy or Dynamic Punch, though these cases are fringe. Itemization is where Avalugg becomes unpredictable. Leftovers (23%) gives 6.25% per turn, letting it stick around to fire multiple Body Presses or Wide Guards; Loaded Dice (35%) turns Ice Spinner into a pseudo-Icicle Spear that can break Focus Sash or Substitute on threats like Flutter Mane or Dragonite; Custap Berry (36%) sits at the intersection of cheese and consistency, allowing Avalugg to move first under 25% HP to fire a game-winning Body Press or Wide Guard before fainting. Tera Fighting is omnipresent (94%) because it removes the 4\u00d7 weakness to Fighting and Steel while boosting STAB Body Press to astronomical levels; the remaining 6% likely run Tera Ice for emergency Freeze-Dry checks or Tera Water to flip Fire matchups, but Fighting is almost strictly superior. Moveset compression is tight: Body Press is mandatory damage, Protect scouts choice locks and gains Leftovers recovery, Ice Spinner is Avalugg\u2019s only way to hit Ghost-types and provides terrain-removal utility, and Wide Guard is the glue that makes Avalugg a support pivot, blocking spread moves from Gholdengo, Torkoal, or Iron Moth that would otherwise shred its slower teammates.</OUTPUT>"

Once on the field it functions as a utility pivot: Electroweb drops both opponents\u2019 Speed by one stage, Thunder Wave can paralyze a single target, and Sucker Punch gives it a form of priority that punishes weakened or frail attackers.  Protect is mandatory to stall Dynamax turns and to gain value from Sitrus Berry or Electric Seed boosts.  The terrain itself boosts Electric-type moves by 30 %, prevents sleep, and activates Electric Seed for a one-stage Defense boost\u2014tools that dedicated teammates can exploit.  Pincurchin\u2019s own stats are unimpressive; 48 / 95 / 85 defenses are merely okay, and 101 Attack is usable but not threatening.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Decidueye\u2019s viability hinges on its ability to act as a multi-purpose pivot that delivers Tailwind, breaks common restricted cores, and preserves momentum with Protect. Timid 252/0/4/252/0/252 guarantees it moves before most support Pok\u00e9mon and many offensive threats in the mid-speed tiers, while Focus Sash cushions any single hit, ensuring Tailwind goes up even against faster leads or spread damage. Shadow Ball is its most consistent STAB, 2HKOing bulky Psychics like Indeedee-F and Calyrex-I after minor chip and cleanly OHKOing Flutter Mane and Lunala after Tera Stellar or Overgrow boosts. Grass Pledge provides critical coverage versus Kyogre, Gastrodon, and Raging Bolt, all of which otherwise wall common Tailwind setters like Tornadus-I or Whimsicott. Protect is mandatory in doubles to stall Fake Out, dodge Zacian\u2019s Behemoth Blade, or preserve Sash for a second Tailwind cycle. Overgrow is preferred because Long Reach offers negligible utility when Decidueye\u2019s main attacks are already contactless; instead, Overgrow turns Grass Pledge into a nuke when Sash is broken, securing unexpected KOs on neutral targets like Gholdengo or Archaludon. Tera Stellar is the overwhelmingly popular choice, providing both offensive and defensive utility: offensively, it makes Shadow Ball neutral on Kingambit and Gholdengo while still hitting Ghosts super-effectively; defensively, it removes Decidueye\u2019s Flying, Ice, and Dark weaknesses for a turn, letting it survive Icerendner from Chien-Pao or Sucker Punch from Kingambit and retaliate or reset Tailwind. The teammate pool reveals a clear archetype: Archaludon and Greninja form a Steel-Water offensive core that abuses Tailwind to outspeed and shred foes with Electro Shot and Hydro Pump; Alolan Ninetales supplies Aurora Veil, which stacks with Focus Sash to make Decidueye almost impossible to OHKO, while also providing Snow and Freeze-Dry coverage; Annihilape and Ursaluna-Bloodmoon are bulky win conditions that appreciate speed control to close out games; Sneasler offers priority Dire Claw and fast Poison coverage versus Fairy-types that trouble Decidueye. Together these Pok\u00e9mon create a balanced offensive structure that leverages speed control, dual screens, and powerful spread moves to overwhelm traditional balance and hard-TR teams alike.</OUTPUT>"

In doubles this means a Rillaboom, Archaludon, or Dragapult can begin firing off +1 Wood Hammers, Flash Cannons, or Phantom Forces on the very same turn, forcing the opponent to choose between targeting the fragile Riolu or the now-boosted threat. Feint strips Protect and Wide Guard from the likes of Toxapex, Amoonguss or opposing Incineroar, ensuring those boosted attacks actually land. Copycat grants further chaos: after a teammate uses a powerful spread move such as Earthquake or a speed-control option like Tailwind, Riolu can immediately copy it with priority, either doubling the pressure or re-setting field conditions. Upper Hand provides emergency Fighting coverage and a flinch chance, punishing slower support Pok\u00e9mon such as Kingambit or Gholdengo. Item choice defines its longevity: Focus Sash guarantees at least one Coaching cycle against hyper-offensive teams, while Eviolite lets it live stray special hits like Dragapult\u2019s Shadow Ball or Incineroar\u2019s Flare Blitz and continue supporting over multiple turns. Tera Ghost is overwhelmingly popular because it grants immunity to Fake Out and allows Riolu to dodge the most common super-effective hits aimed at it (Close Combat, Mach Punch, Sucker Punch), while Tera Dark blocks Prankster Taunt and gives a slight damage bonus to Upper Hand. EV spreads are straightforward: maximum Speed with a Jolly nature outspeeds neutral-nature base 95s and ensures Prankster moves land before opposing priority, while the second spread sacrifices its own HP to invest in Attack for slightly stronger Upper Hand. The remainder of analyses show minimal deviation, indicating the community has converged on an optimized support set.</OUTPUT>"

At 196 EVs and a Timid nature it outspeeds max-speed Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Valiant, letting it fire the first Icy Wind or Taunt before those threats move. Levitate is the only ability worth using; it grants immunity to Earthquake, Earth Power, and Spikes, allowing Mismagius to switch into common spread attackers like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu with impunity. The chosen Calm spread (148 HP / 164 SpD / 196 Spe) survives Life Orb Chien-Pao Ice Spinner, modest Iron Valiant Moonblast, and Jolly Chien-Pao Sacred Sword after burn, while still creeping positive-nature base 110s. Safety Goggles is the dominant item because it blanks Amoonguss, rage powder users, and hail chip, turning Mismagius into a hard stop to redirection strategies. Focus Sash is the fallback on more offensive teams where entry hazards or double-target pressure are expected. Four-moveslot syndrome is real: Icy Wind provides speed control that benefits both special and physical allies, Will-o-Wisp neuters physical sweepers like Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Sneasler, Taunt prevents Trick Room, Tailwind, and setup moves, while Protect preserves positioning and stalls out Dynamax turns. Tera Ghost is taken when you need to block Extreme Speed or retain Ghost STAB versus Calyrex-I, but Tera Steel is overwhelmingly preferred: it removes the Ghost weakness to opposing Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, adds crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel, and turns Mismagius into a pseudo-steel wall that can pivot on Sylveon, Chien-Pao, and Iron Valiant. The listed teammates\u2014Incineroar, Kilowattrel, Tyranitar, Sneasler, Indeedee, and Excadrill\u2014show Mismagius fits on both sun/boar cores and sand squads, offering speed control for slow powerhouses and burn support for frail attackers.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Speed is Infernape\u2019s calling card: at 108 it beats every relevant support except Talonflame and the rare Noivern, allowing it to fire off Fake Out before opposing redirection or speed control. Close Combat is a 120 BP nuke that cleanly OHKOs standard Incineroar, Kingambit and Chi-Yu after Stealth Rock or one round of chip, while Heat Wave spreads 95 BP special damage and keeps the monkey from being walled by Fairy- and Bug-types. Aura Sphere is chosen over Mach Punch on roughly half of sets to maintain power against Dynamax targets and bypass accuracy woes, but Mach Punch remains a tech to pick off Focus Sash users and finish weakened Flutter Mane or Dragapult. The item is almost always Focus Sash\u2014Infernape\u2019s bulk is simply too poor to stomach two neutral hits without it\u2014while Tera choices revolve around either Stellar for a one-time 80 % power boost to both STABs or Grass to remove Water weakness and punish Rotom-Wash, Urshifu-R and Palafin. Stellar is especially potent because it ignores Wide Guard, letting Heat Wave smack both foes through what would otherwise be a hard counter. EV spreads are polarized: Jolly 252/4/252 maximizes speed and power for a pure offensive pivot, whereas Rash 0/4/0/252/0/252 is a niche mixed variant that guarantees the OHKO on 252 HP / 0 SpD Corviknight with Overheat while still outspeeding Jolly Garchomp. Blaze is taken for consistency, but Iron Fist variants add roughly 20 % damage to Mach Punch and Aura Sphere, securing key rolls on Chien-Pao and Gholdengo. In practice Infernape functions as a lead or mid-game pivot: Fake Out plus a partner\u2019s Tailwind or Rage Powder creates an immediate tempo swing, then STAB moves clean the board while Sash preserves at least one additional turn of output. Because it lacks Incineroar\u2019s Parting Shot, the ape must rely on hard reads and protective teammates to escape bad matchups, but its higher speed and mixed offenses give it a uniquely aggressive angle that Incineroar simply cannot replicate.</OUTPUT>"

Ghost-types like Aegislash and Mimikyu punish Close Combat drops and can stall with Protect, but Iron Fist Aura Sphere breaks Mimikyu\u2019s Disguise and deals respectable neutral damage to Aegislash shield form. Opposing Incineroar wars are common: Infernape wins the speed tie and OHKOs with Close Combat, but must beware Parting Shot chip and potential Intimidate cycling. In rain teams, Infernape is largely neutered unless it Terastallizes, so smart opponents will bait the Tera turn then pivot to Swift Swim sweepers. Overall, Infernape\u2019s matchups are polarized: it bulldozes mid-speed balance squads but struggles against hyper-offense or bulky Water terrain unless it commits its Tera.</OUTPUT>"

Leech Seed turns Thwackey into a passive win-condition against bulky cores lacking Grass-immune or Clear-Body Pok\u00e9mon; pairing it with Protect lets it stall Dynamax turns and rack up 25 % recovery per cycle. U-turn guarantees momentum against Protect or predicted switches, ensuring you rarely lose tempo.

Modest 252 SpA Surfs hit 156 base power in rain and cleanly KO standard Incineroar after one round of chip, while Air Slash\u2019s 30% flinch chance gives it pseudo-speed control against slower threats. Roost lets it play a longer game against bulky cores, and Protect is mandatory to dodge double-targets and stall out Tailwind turns. The EV spread maximizes damage and bulk: 137 HP guarantees that Sitrus activates after two rounds of Life Orb recoil or one super-effective hit, 166 Def survives Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner, and 156 SpA secures the above KOs. Tera Ghost is preferred on offensive teams that need a Fake Out absorber and want to block Shadow Sneak from opposing Kingambit, while Tera Steel is the default on balance squads that need to keep Cramorant on the field into the late game versus Electric or Rock attackers.

The chosen EV spread is almost always Adamant 4/252/0/0/0/252 to maximize immediate power and speed; a bulkier 68/236/12/0/20/172 spread survives a Life Orb Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and still outspeeds +1 base 110s under hail. Life Orb is the most common item, turning Iron Head into a guaranteed OHKO on bulky variants of Flutter Mane and 2HKOing Dondozo, while Loaded Dice gives Triple Axel a 96 % chance to hit three times, effectively a 120 BP single-target move that ignores accuracy checks. Focus Sash is rarer but guarantees a setup opportunity against faster leads like Talonflame. Ice Spinner is mandatory for terrain removal, crucial against Psychic Terrain teams that rely on Indeedee\u2013Armarouge or Indeedee\u2013Venusaur. Protect is universal in doubles, and Ice Shard picks off weakened foes such as Chien-Pao or opposing Slush Rush users. Tera Ghost is the standout choice, removing the Fighting weakness and letting Sandslash punish Fake Out users while gaining perfect neutral coverage with Iron Head + Ice Spinner.

Its movepool is sparse but perfectly tailored for support: Fake Out provides free turns, Parting Shot simultaneously neuters attackers and maintains momentum, Crunch prevents it from being completely passive by hitting Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Indeedee-F, and Flare Blitz offers a STAB option that can finish off weakened foes or break Focus Sashes. Tera Ghost is preferred to block Fake Out and Extreme Speed while dodging Fighting-type coverage, whereas Tera Grass removes the Water weakness and helps it stomach Amoonguss\u2019s Sludge Bomb. The dominance of Eviolite on nearly every set underlines that Torracat\u2019s value lies in staying power rather than raw damage output.</OUTPUT>"

Iron Head becomes a 100%-accurate, 130 BP Steel move post-STAB and Tera, nailing Flutter Mane, Sylveon and Mimikyu for OHKOs that Close Combat cannot achieve. The listed EV spreads illustrate the two schools of thought: the 252/156/12 bulk variant survives Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and can retalates, whereas the 116 HP/132 Speed variant guarantees the speed jump on Timid Gholdengo and Modest Sylveon after boost. Defiant is chosen on 57% of teams because it flips the ubiquitous Intimidate\u2013Parting Shot core on its head: a single Incineroar Intimidate turns Falinks into a +3 Attack monster that is almost impossible to wall without dedicated intimidate cycling or Unaware. Life Orb is the only item worth considering: the 30% damage bonus turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs and the recoil is offset by Falinks\u2019 plan to end games in three turns or fewer. Tera Steel is used on nearly 90% of teams because it removes the crippling Fairy and Flying weaknesses, grants a crucial Toxic immunity, and provides a 2\u00d7 Iron Head boost that secures KOs on Togekiss and Sylveon even through Tera Fairy. Battle Armor is almost never seen, but the occasional anti-crit tech can be justified on hyper-offensive teams that cannot afford to lose damage rolls to random critical hits.

After a Shell Smash it reaches +2 Speed and +2 SpA, turning its modest 104 base Special Attack into an effective 208 and outspeeding even Choice Scarf base 100s. White Herb is used on roughly 59% of teams to erase the Defense drops, allowing it to survive priority such as Sucker Punch or Aqua Jet and continue sweeping; Focus Sash (19%) is reserved for more offensive structures that need a guaranteed Smash versus faster attackers, while Safety Goggles (18%) lets it ignore Amoonguss\u2019s Rage Powder and Spore, a key tech when paired with its own redirection. The two main spreads are both Timid: the 204/20/52/4/228 variant hits 167 Speed, enough to outrun Timid Dragapult at +2, while the slightly bulkier 124/68/84/4/228 spread lives Jolly Dragonite\u2019s Tera-Normal Extreme Speed at -1 from Weak Armor. Modest sets exist but are far less common, trading the speed benchmark for immediate power. Tera-Fighting is overwhelmingly preferred because at +2 it OHKOes standard Incineroar, Kingambit, and Gholdengo while retaining perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball. The Ghost typing precludes Fake Out and grants valuable immunities to Extreme Speed and Rapid Spin, but also invites Dark-types and opposing Ghosts that can stomach a +2 Shadow Ball. Polteageist therefore demands either redirection or a free turn to set up, and its sweeping window is narrow\u2014once White Herb or Sash is consumed, priority or a faster attacker will usually finish it off.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Misdreavus\u2019s niche in the current regulation is built around three pillars: Eviolite bulk, Levitate immunities, and a support movepool that no other Ghost-type in the tier replicates. 116/140/116 defensive investment with an Eviolite allows it to survive Jolly Rillaboom Wood Hammer, Adamant Incineroar Flare Blitz, and Modest Primarina Moonblast, giving it genuine switch-in capability versus the most common offensive cores. Once in, it can immediately pressure the opponent: Icy Wind drops both enemies\u2019 Speed, turning the likes of Iron Crown, Ogerpon-Wellspring, and Dragapult into liabilities for your partner to KO; Will-O-Wisp neuters physical sweepers such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Incineroar; and Curse trades 25% of its own HP for a guaranteed 1/4 max-HP cut on any target, breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy while forcing Protect stalling that buys free turns for teammates. Hex is chosen over Shadow Ball because the entire set is designed to status the field first and then clean for 130 base power spread damage. Tera Fairy is the consensus option: it removes the only weakness Misdreavus has to Ghost- and Dark-type moves, grants a Dragon immunity to blank Miraidon Flutter Mane or Dialga Palkia, and preserves the valuable Fairy typing for end-game Tera wars. Tera Ghost is a lower-usage but legitimate alternative when the team already packs Tera Fairy elsewhere and wants to stack Ghost resists or enable Fake Out immunity. The Calm nature spread is preferred on hard Trick Room teams where you want to underspeed as much as possible, while the Hardy spread is taken on balance squads that still want slow Icy Wind but need slightly more mixed bulk. Both spreads outspeed uninvested base 80s such as Togekiss and Mew after an Icy Wind drop, ensuring you can still move before them in subsequent turns. The 36 Defense on the Calm spread guarantees you never drop to a -1 Incineroar Flare Blitz after Grassy Terrain recovery, while the 140 Defense on the Hardy spread lets you live Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner through Reflect. In practice Misdreavus is rarely the dynamax target; instead it uses its bulk to stick around, spread status, and then let partners such as Rillaboom or Primarina dynamax safely. Its low offensive stats mean it cannot break through dedicated special walls like Blissey or Clodsire, but its role is to enable teammates rather than sweep outright.</OUTPUT>"

Versus Incineroar it trades evenly: Calm spread survives Flare Blitz and can burn back, but Knock Off cripples it long-term, so you must Tera immediately if Eviolite removal is threatened. Into Iron Crown, Miraidon, and Dragapult it is a full stop: Icy Wind drops their Speed to unusable levels and Ghost typing blocks Fake Out, forcing them to target the partner instead. Against Trick Room it flips the script: because Misdreavus is naturally slower than Hatterene, Indeedee, and Stakataka, it can fire Icy Wind or Will-O-Wisp before they move, breaking potential Trick Room turns or burning the setter. Into sun or rain hyper-offense it struggles: Chi-Yu and Iron Moth overpower even the Calm spread, while Swift Swim Barraskeweda outspeeds and OHKOs with Liquidation. Kingambit is a 50-50: if you burn it on the switch you win, but if it Swords Dance on the predicted Will-O-Wisp it can OHKO through Eviolite with a +2 Dark-type move. Ditto for Chien-Pao: Hardy spread lives Ice Spinner but not a Tera Dark Crunch, so you must Tera Fairy pre-emptively or rely on partner intimidates.

Rivalry and Unnerve are almost irrelevant in comparison, offering negligible utility. Item choice defines Haxorus\u2019s archetype: Loaded Dice boosts the consistency of Scale Shot to +2 Attack after one use, turning Haxorus into a snowballing cleaner; Clear Amulet ignores Intimidate and Parting Shot, preserving its immediate power against cores built around Incineroar and Murkrow; Choice Scarf turns Haxorus into a surprise revenge killer that can pick off faster threats such as Cinderace or opposing Dragapult.

Skill Link guarantees five hits on Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, giving it a pseudo-base-125 Ice move and a Rock move that breaks Sash, Sturdy, and Focus Band while also punishing Tera Fire and Tera Flying switch-ins. After a Shell Smash the combination reaches 634 effective Attack and 526 Speed, outspeeding every unboosted Scarfer in the format and 2HKOing even bulky resists such as Tera Water Incineroar. White Herb variants remove the Defense drop, allowing Cloyster to survive priority moves like Grassy Glide or Sucker Punch and finish off the attacker on the following turn. King\u2019s Rock variants trade that safety for a 41% cumulative flinch chance, turning every multi-hit move into a coin-flip that can dismantle defensive cores. Tera Water is preferred on offensive teams because it removes the 4\u00d7 Rock weakness, keeps the Ice STAB, and synergises with Rain teams that already pack Thunder or Hurricane support. Tera Grass is chosen on squads that need to answer Rotom-Wash, Iron Leaves, or Amoonguss, flipping the Grass weakness into a resistance and baiting Electric-type moves that would otherwise KO. The Careful spread survives Modest Iron Moth Overheat and Timid Iron Bundle Freeze-Dry, while the Adamant spread guarantees the OHKO on 252 HP Tera Fire Gholdengo after Stealth Rock damage.

The 252 HP / 156 SpA / 100 SpD Quiet spread guarantees the OHKO on 252 HP Gholdengo with Earth Power after Weakness Policy, while the bulkier 252 HP / 252 SpD variant survives Choice Specs Tatsugiri Muddy Water and +1 Hydreigon Draco Meteor, ensuring policy activation. Once activated, Palossand\u2019s Special Attack effectively doubles, turning modest uninvested Shadow Balls into 2HKOs on max-invested support Grimmsnarl and bulky Toxapex. Shore Up is mandatory for longevity, recovering 66 % in sand and 50 % outside it, letting Palossand repeatedly switch in and trade. Giga Drain rounds the coverage by punishing bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Gastrodon that otherwise wall its STABs. The ability split shows Water Compaction (\u224851 %) is preferred over Sand Veil; the Defense jump after any Water hit makes Palossand almost physically unbreakable and further deters Aqua Step or Jet users from attempting to snipe it. Tera Grass removes the Water weakness entirely and turns Giga Drain into a spammable recovery option, while Tera Rock grants a crucial resistance to Flying and Bug, letting Palossand survive Brave Bird from offensive Flamigo or Tera Flying Dragonite and retaliate with Rock Slide or Earth Power. The presence of Tyranitar as a top teammate indicates sand cores are still viable; Tyranitar sets sand, chips with Rock Slide, and deters special attackers with Assault Vest sets, while Palossand covers Fighting-type weaknesses and absorbs Knock Off for the team. Smeargle provides Fake Out and Silk Trap support, ensuring Trick Room goes up, and can pivot into Palossand with Follow Me to guarantee a Weakness Policy trigger. Flamigo offers Tailwind removal via Court Change and a secondary Fighting resist, whereas Gholdengo blocks opposing hazards and spreads status, creating a hazard-stacking core with Palossand\u2019s Shore Up stalling.</OUTPUT>"

The terrain boost also strengthens its own Electric STAB, letting it muscle past bulky waters and Flying types with ease. Focus Sash variants guarantee at least one attack or support move, making Raichu a reliable Fake Out user and lead option, while Life Orb variants trade safety for immediate wall-breaking power.

Gigaton Hammer\u2019s 160 BP is the hardest single-target Fairy STAB in the format, but the recharge clause forces Tinkaton to switch or protect the following turn, so it is played as a hit-and-run breaker rather than a sustained sweeper. Encore is the centerpiece move: because Mold Breaker ignores Mental Herb, Tinkaton can lock opposing support Pok\u00e9mon into Protect, Trick Room, or Tailwind and then pivot to a faster partner such as Cinderace or Tauros-Paldea-Aqua to capitalise. Fake Out provides the classic tempo lead, while Knock Off removes problematic items like Clear Amulet, Sitrus Berry, or Eviolite from Dusclops and Murkrow. The listed Tera types\u2014Ghost and Water\u2014are defensive answers: Tera Ghost dodges Fighting-type Fake Out and grants a Normal immunity, letting Tinkaton Encore or Gigaton Hammer against Ursaluna or Iron Hands, while Tera Water removes the Fire and Ground weaknesses and turns incoming Fire Blast or Earthquake into resisted hits. The 16 % Mold Breaker usage rate shows that players who do bring Tinkaton understand its job; the remainder run Own Tempo or Pickpocket, which are largely wasted slots.

Because hazards remain in Doubles until cleared by Mortal Spin or Rapid Spin, Kleavor can single-handedly punish the ubiquitous pivoting of Incineroar, Gholdengo and Amoonguss while simultaneously chunking the opposing slot. Sharpness is the ability of choice on more than 94% of sets, raising Stone Axe, X-Scissor and, situationally, Dual Wingbeat to 97.5 BP, 120 BP and 90 BP respectively\u2014numbers that let it OHKO frail support Pok\u00e9mon such as Murkrow, Tornadus-I and even offensive Gholdengo after hazard damage. Choice Scarf variants (24.8%) outspeed the entire unboosted tier except Regieleki and Iron Bundle, turning Kleavor into a reliable late-game cleaner that can still bluff a Focus Sash because of the identical HP numbers. Focus Sash sets (54.3%) trade immediate speed for setup insurance, guaranteeing at least one layer of hazards and often drawing double-targets that free up its partner to set Trick Room, Rain or Dragon Dance. EV spreads are simple: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with either Adamant or Jolly nature; Jolly is the majority (34.5%) because it secures the speed tie against opposing base 105s such as Iron Valiant and ensures the Scarf set outruns +1 Dragonite. Tera Water is the most popular option (30%) because it flips the 4\u00d7 Fire weakness into a resistance, letting Kleavor survive Heat Wave from Torkoal or Sun-boosted Eruption from Chi-Yu, while Tera Fighting (30.9%) is taken when the team already packs rain or wants a stronger Close Combat to muscle past Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Protect is mandatory in Doubles and appears on virtually every set, giving Kleavor a safe click against Fake Out or priority users and allowing it to preserve Sash or Scout Choice locks.</OUTPUT>"

Inner Focus is the preferred ability on most teams, preventing flinches from Fake Out or Rock Slide that could stop an opening Trick Room; Telepathy sees niche use alongside Earthquake or Discharge partners, though such synergy is rare in current formats. Mental Herb is the only item worth considering, removing the threat of Taunt or Encore from opposing Whimsicott, Grimmsnarl, or Murkrow and ensuring at least one successful Trick Room. The chosen spread (Sassy 232/0/228/28/12/8) places 232 EVs in HP and 228 in Defense, letting it survive -1 Tera Dark Kingambit Iron Head or Choice Band Dragonite Extreme Speed, while the 28 Special Attack guarantees the OHKO on 4 HP Tera Poison Amoonguss with Psychic. The remaining EVs are split between Special Defense and a token 8 Speed to creep other minimal-speed supports. Instruct is the marquee move: once per turn it orders the target ally to repeat its previous move, effectively doubling the output of heavy hitters like Ursaluna or Torkoal without consuming a second turn. Encore punishes setup sweepers or Protect spam, locking them into a harmless move and buying free turns for the Trick Room sweepers. Psychic prevents Oranguru from being complete Taunt bait and snipes Amoonguss or Toxapex for chip. Tera Dark is the safest option, removing the Ghost weakness and granting immunity to Prankster Taunt, while Tera Fairy offers a Dragon immunity and better synergy against Dark-types; Tera Steel is a distant third, granting a Flash Fire-style resistance but leaving it weak to common Fire and Ground coverage.</OUTPUT>"

Offensively, Power Whip supplies a 120 BP STAB capable of 2HKOing most bulky Waters and Grounds, while Triple Axel (triple kick) hits Dragons, Flying, and opposing Grass-types for at least base 60 power per hit, breaking Sash and getting around Covert Cloak. High Jump Kick gives it a 130 BP nuke versus Steel- and Normal-types such as Kingambit or Snorlax, albeit with the usual crash risk. Helping Hand lets Tsareena stay relevant in Doubles even when its coverage is redundant, boosting partner spread moves like Bloodmoon Ursaluna\u2019s Hyper Voice or Pelipper\u2019s Hurricane. EV spreads are not supplied, but the Wide Lens item hints at an accuracy patch for all three attacks, implying a 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly or Adamant set is most common, perhaps with a bulk investment to survive a neutral hit. Tera Fire removes Ice and Fairy weaknesses while baiting opposing Sun or Ice teams; Tera Steel grants a pile of resistances plus a Toxic immunity; Tera Fighting boosts High Jump Kick and turns Tsareena into a pseudo-Fighting-type wallbreaker. Overall, Tsareena demands careful positioning but rewards teams that can cover its Flying-, Poison-, and Bug-type shortcomings while exploiting the free turns Queenly Majesty generates.</OUTPUT>"

Fighting/Fire gives it a crucial neutrality to Fairy and a resistance to Ice, Bug and Steel, while 100/105/80 bulk is reasonable when backed by Intimidate. Offensively, 110 Attack and 110 Speed let it speed-tie Iron Valiant and naturally outrun the likes of Chien-Pao, Gholdengo, Bundle, and non-Choice Scarf Dragons. Raging Bull is the star move: a 90 BP STAB that shatters Reflect and Light Screen on contact, punishing the ubiquitous Grimmsnarl/Indeedee set-up cores that define the current metagame. Close Combat provides a second reliable STAB that nails Kingambit, Garganacl and opposing Tauros. Will-o-Wisp lets the bull cripple physical set-up sweepers such as Kingambit, Dragonite and Palafin, while Protect is mandatory for doubles play, enabling partner positioning, Leftovers-less recovery, and prediction games. Tera Grass is chosen on roughly three out of four sets because it removes the 4\u00d7 Water weakness, turns Electric into a resistance, and leaves Tauros with only a single Fire resistance drop while keeping Raging Bull as a neutral hit. EV spreads are straightforward: Jolly nature with 252 Speed and 4 HP maximises the speed-tie range and ensures the fastest possible Will-o-Wisp or Raging Bull; 252 Attack guarantees key benchmarks such as a 75% chance to OHKO 4 HP Gholdengo with Raging Bull after Intimidate, and 75% to 2HKO 252 HP Garganacl through Tera.

Close Combat punts opposing Steels that otherwise wall you, 2HKOing standard Assault Vest Garganacl and OHKOing Tera-Normal Dragonite through Multiscale after rocks. U-turn is the glue of the set: because Scyther is the fastest user of the move among viable pivots, it almost always gains momentum, and the chip it absorbs while tanking a hit can be converted into free switches for powerful wall-breakers like Sneasler or Specs Sylveon. Protect is obligatory for doubles play, scouting choice locks, stalling Tailwind turns, and enabling partner speed control. Tera Steel is the consensus pick, turning Scyther into a pseudo-steel type with only two weaknesses (Fire and Fighting) and a bevy of crucial resists, but Tera Dragon and Tera Fire remain solid alternatives that respectively punish Rotom-Wash and opposing Steels.

Once Trick Room is active, Mimikyu\u2019s awkward base 96 Speed becomes an asset, letting it move before most of the metagame under reversed speeds. Careful nature plus 228 HP / 228 SpD gives Mimikyu enough special bulk to live Life Orb Moonblast from Flutter Mane or Choice Specs Hydro Steam from Walking Wake, meaning it can usually stay on the field for multiple turns to fire off attacks or continued support. Shadow Sneak is deceptely useful: it breaks Focus Sashes, finishes off weakened Dynamax targets, and provides a last-ditch pick-off when Trick Room is about to expire. Play Rough\u2019s 90% accuracy is a drawback, but the Fairy typing is invaluable for punishing Dragons, Urshifu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Taunt shuts down other support Pok\u00e9mon like Murkrow, Pelipper, or enemy Trick Room setters, while also preventing Recover, Parting Shot, or Tailwind. Life Orb is preferred on offensive teams where Mimikyu doubles as a win-condition, whereas Mental Herb is better on hard Trick Room squads that cannot afford to lose momentum to Taunt or Encore. Tera Ghost is the most flexible, removing the sole Ghost weakness and granting an immunity to Fake Out and Extreme Speed, but Tera Grass lets Mimikyu stomach Kyogre\u2019s Water Spout or Rillaboom\u2019s Grassy Glide, and Tera Steel provides a handy resistance to both Fairy and Ice while keeping a neutrality to Steel-type moves that would otherwise dent Mimikyu.</OUTPUT>"

The chosen Sassy nature and EV spreads (either 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 SpD or 252 HP / 76 Def / 180 SpD) maximise special bulk while keeping enough Defence to avoid the 2HKO from common physical threats such as Chien-Pao or Kingambit. Follow Me is the cornerstone move, forcing the opponent to target Clefairy and freeing partners to set up, click setup moves, or simply nuke the field with boosted attacks. Helping Hand adds 50 % damage to any ally move, turning would-be survivals into knock-outs and flipping speed-tie scenarios. Life Dew provides 25 % healing to both Clefairy and its partner, punishing opponents for failing to secure simultaneous KOs and giving your side a second lease on the game. Protect is mandatory for stalling out Dynamax turns, blocking Fake Out, and gaining positioning. Terastallization is used reactively: Steel removes the Poison weakness and adds crucial resistances to Dragon and Ice; Grass punishes Water-types looking to soak up hits; Fairy keeps STAB Moonblast options alive on more offensive variants and adds a Dragon immunity.

Terastallization match-ups hinge on typing: Ghost Tera blanks Fake Out and Mach Punch but still folds to Knock Off, while Fighting Tera invites Tera Fairy Sylveon or Tera Flying Corviknight to stall it out. Overall, Stonjourner\u2019s match-ups are defined less by itself and more by whether its partner can leverage Power Spot faster than the opponent can remove the statue.</OUTPUT>"

Corrosion in particular is the selling point: being able to badly poison Tera Fairy Kingambit, Tera Water Dondozo, or opposing Garganacl ignores the usual immunity clauses that keep these threats healthy. Poison Gas, chosen on every sampled set, is the optimal delivery mechanism\u2014100% accurate, spread, and non-attacking, so it bypasses Follow Me and allies can still benefit from the status. Heat Wave provides reliable spread damage into Amoonguss, Kingambit, and Gholdengo while also threatening the ever-present Tera Steel users. Sludge Wave is the strongest spread Poison option available, nailing Tera Fairy users and opposing Dragonite after a Dragon Dance. Fake Out gives the team tempo, letting partners such as Calm Mind Dondozo or Dragonite set up, or simply breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs guarantees the speed tie with opposing base-117 threats like Iron Moth and ensures Salazzle always moves before neutral-natured Dragapult, while 252 Special Attack maximizes the damage output of its spread moves. Focus Sash guarantees that Salazzle survives at least one hit, letting it fire off two moves in most games\u2014often one status and one attack.

EV spreads should follow the standard 252/252 on Salazzle, max HP and balanced defenses on Dondozo, and offensive spreads on the remaining attackers. This configuration matches the usage stats while providing flexibility against every major archetype in Regulation G.</OUTPUT>"

Multi-hit STAB Water Shuriken bypasses Focus Sash and deals deceptively high damage to neutral targets\u2014especially under rain, where the 1.5\u00d7 boost turns each hit into a 112.5 BP equivalent.

Haze is invaluable speed control that removes opposing Tailwind, Iron Defense or Calm Mind stacks, while Rain Dance lets Greninja reset weather for Pelipper or deny opposing Sun/Sand for a crucial turn. Tera Ghost is the standout option: it removes the Fighting weakness, blocks Rapid Spin, and turns Greninja into an immune Fake Out/Extreme Speed target while still allowing Protean type-changes on subsequent moves. EV spreads are not yet standardised, but 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid is the safe baseline to outrun +1 Roaring Moon and neutral Iron Valiant; remaining EVs can be funnelled into bulk or shifted to Attack if a mixed Protean set ever becomes relevant.

The chosen Timid 252/4/188 spread hits 167 Speed, outspeeding max-speed base 90s such as Ludicolo and neutral-natured Iron Moth, while 64 EVs in bulk plus Psychic Seed or Covert Cloak let Golduck survive a -1 Astral Barrage from standard Indeedee-F or a Tera Fairy Moonblast from Flutter Mane. Aqua Jet gives the team a much-needed priority option that secures KOs on sash holders and weakened speed-boosted sweepers. Taunt is the glue that justifies Golduck\u2019s inclusion: it prevents Trick Room, denies Tailwind from Whimsicott or Tornadus, and stops Calm Mind or Bulk Up setups cold. Protect is mandatory doubles glue, buying time for partner positioning and allowing Cloud Nine to suppress weather for an extra turn. Tera Grass removes Electric and Grass weaknesses while turning Golduck into a surprise check to Rotom-Wash and Miraidon; Tera Ice scores fast OHKOs on Dragapult, Amoonguss, and Lando-T after chip; Tera Fighting grants a crucial resistance to Rock and allows Golduck to punish Incineroar and Kingambit with Tera Blast if desired.

Versus sand, it removes Excadrill\u2019s sand rush and Tyranitar\u2019s SpD boost, turning the match-up heavily in its favor unless Excadrill carries Rock Slide. Into Trick Room, Ninetales\u2019 Encore can shut down Hatterene or Indeedee trying to set, but if the room goes up Ninetales\u2019 poor bulk means it often becomes dead weight, so it pairs best with Taunt or Imprison users. Against Sun mirror matchups, Ninetales is faster than Torkoal and can encore it into a passive move, but must avoid Overheat spitting wars it will lose to Torkoal\u2019s higher SpA. Into offense, sash guarantees one meaningful turn; however, strong spread or priority like Chien-Pao Ice Shard plus Rock Slide can KO it through sash, so Protect positioning is key. Stall cores dislike Encore locking them into recovery, but bulky waters such as Slowbro or Gastrodon wall Ninetales entirely if sun is overwritten. Overall, Ninetales\u2019 matchups hinge on weather control and Encore value; if it achieves both, it swings games, but if opponents preserve their weather or carry faster Fake Out, Ninetales becomes a liability.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Empoleon\u2019s unique blend of Steel/Water typing, respectable natural bulk and the coveted Competitive ability make it one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that can simultaneously check Fairy- and Ice-type spam while turning opposing stat-drops into game-winning momentum. In current VGC environments heavy into Incineroar, Landorus-T and Salamence, Intimidate cycling is ubiquitous; Empoleon flips that script, gaining +2 Special Attack every time it is Intimidated or hit by Snarl, Struggle Bug or Parting Shot. Once at +2, Modest Flash Cannon reaches frightening levels of power (\u2248150 BP after STAB and Competitive), cleanly OHKOing standard Togekiss, Tapu Fini and non-Assault-Vest Indeedee-F, while Ice Beam nails the omnipresent Dragon- and Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Rillaboom and Garchomp. Water Pledge is chosen over Scald or Muddy Water because it benefits from spread damage, breaks sashes, and\u2014crucially\u2014synergises with teammate Grass Pledge to lay a 4-turn sea-of-fire (\u22481/6 chip + 12.5% burn chance). This interaction enables Empoleon to function as both attacker and hazard setter, something few other Water-types can boast. Protect is mandatory doubles glue, scouting Choice items and denying double-target KOs. The two main spreads serve different archetypes: Quiet 252/0/0/252/4/0 maximises power and works under Trick Room, letting Empoleon function as a slow wallbreaker that still outspeeds most uninvested base 50s; Modest 140/0/0/252/4/108 creeps up to 119 Speed, outspeeding neutral-nature base 70s while retaining enormous bulk. Item choice determines play-style: Leftovers offsets Stealth Rock chip and gives Empoleon 6.25% recovery every turn, excellent for longer games and synergy with Protect; Assault Vest transforms Empoleon into a special sponge capable of tanking Choice Specs Tapu Koko Thunderbolt or Life Orb Hydreigon Draco Meteor and retaliating for the KO. Tera Ghost is the standout Tera type, removing Fighting weakness and granting immunity to Fake Out and ExtremeSpeed, letting Empoleon act as a stop-gap versus priority-reliant teams. Tera Water is a safe alternative that boosts STAB Flash Cannon and Water Pledge while removing the Fire resistance, useful versus sun teams. Empoleon\u2019s main drawback is its reliance on Competitive triggers\u2014teams that forego Intimidate or stat-drops force Empoleon to play a more passive role until it can find boosts elsewhere. Additionally, while Empoleon\u2019s special bulk is excellent, its physical defence is merely average, leaving it vulnerable to strong Earthquakes, Close Combats and Wood Hammers. Nevertheless, with proper support Empoleon can single-handedly dismantle standard archetypes while providing invaluable defensive utility.</OUTPUT>"

Electric-types like Zapdos, Regieleki and Thundurus force Empoleon out, though Assault Vest variants can survive non-boosted Thunderbolts and 2HKO back with Ice Beam.

Strong physical attackers that do not rely on Intimidate\u2014such as Choice Band Rillaboom, Life Orb Kartana and Iron Valiant\u2014can OHKO with Wood Hammer or Close Combat before Empoleon can retaliate. Electric-types like Regieleki and Choice Specs Zapdos outspeed and KO with Thunderbolt even through Assault Vest if Empoleon has not Terastallized. Grass-types remain the most reliable counters: Amoonguss can clear boosts with Clear Smog and put Empoleon to sleep with Spore, while Tapu Bulu\u2019s Grassy Glide or Wood Hammer ends Empoleon after minimal chip. Priority users such as Conkeldurr\u2019s Mach Punch or Kingambit\u2019s Sucker Punch can finish off weakened Empoleon, though Tera Ghost blanks these attempts. Tera Fire Incineroar flips the script by resisting both Flash Cannon and Ice Beam and threatening with Flare Blitz, while Tera Ground Garchomp lives Ice Beam and OHKOs with Earthquake. Finally, Empoleon dislikes status: burn halves its already modest physical offense, while paralysis cripples its speed control options. To counter Empoleon, bring dedicated Grass or Electric attackers, preserve Tera types to absorb Ice Beam or Flash Cannon, and avoid unnecessary Intimidate cycles. If Empoleon has already acquired +2, focus on double-targeting it or using strong neutral special attacks before it can move; without boosts, Empoleon is merely a bulky Water/Steel type that can be worn down with repeated super-effective hits.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Blastoise\u2019s main draw is the combination of Fake Out and powerful spread Water moves, giving it an immediate tempo option while pressaging opposing leads. Water Spout\u2019s 150 BP at full health is among the strongest spread attacks in the format, 2HKOing even neutral bulky Pok\u00e9mon under Torrent or Mystic Water; the listed spread guarantees a OHKO on non-Dynamaxed 4 HP Tornadus-I and roughly 80% on standard Incineroar after prior chip. Muddy Water trades raw power for accuracy and Sp. Acc. drops, excellent for disrupting Trick Room or Tailwind setters while still chunking most neutral targets for 35-45%. Fake Out allows partners like Archaludon or Dragapult to set up or attack safely, while Protect preserves Blastoise\u2019s HP for a stronger Spout on later turns. Rain Dish variants under Pelipper rain recover 1/8 HP per turn, turning Blastoise into a serviceable pivot that can repeatedly fire perfectly-accurate Hurricanes or Thunders from teammates. The EV spread maximises speed to outpace positive-nature base-100s (including opposing Dragapult) while keeping bulk investment to survive +1 Tera Grass Leaf Blade from Meowscarada or Thunderbolt from Life Orb Miraidon after Dynamax. White Herb variants negate Intimidate or Overheat drops, preserving offensive potency, whereas Assault Vest shores up its merely decent special bulk to take Flutter Mane Moonbursts or Iron Bundle Freeze-Dries. Tera Water is the default, multiplying its STAB to ludicrous levels\u2014guaranteeing the OHKO on max-SpDef Garganacl after Stealth Rock chip\u2014and also removing burn damage for longevity. Tera Grass is situationally invaluable against Rotom-Wash, Iron Bundle, or Miraidon, flipping Electric weakness into resistance and allowing Blastoise to tank Volt Switch and retaliate with Spout or Ice Beam coverage if chosen. The listed teammates synergise by covering weaknesses: Pelipper sets rain, removes Fire weakness, and itself threatens opposing Water absorbers; Archaludon enjoys rain-boosted Steel Beam and breaks through bulky Waters that wall Blastoise; Incineroar provides Parting Shot and Intimidate to buy set-up turns; Galarian Weezing neutralises weather and abilities like Protosynthesis while spreading status; Meowscarada offers priority and Grass coverage to KO opposing Waters and Gastrodon; Dragapult supplies speed control and acts as a secondary Dynamax option to bait Fairy and Dragon damage away from Blastoise.

Sludge Bomb is the primary nuke, 2HKOing most neutral targets and OHKOing Fairy and Grass foes like Flutter Mane, Meowscarada and opposing Venusaur. Earth Power nails Toxapex, Gholdengo and Heatran for heavy damage, while Weather Ball becomes a 100-base-power Fire move under sun, eliminating Corviknight, Kingambit and Garganacl that would otherwise wall the set. Sleep Powder is the glue that turns would-be counters into setup fodder; with Covert Cloak preventing Indeedee\u2019s Follow Me from flinching, Venusaur can reliably put a target to sleep, shift momentum, and allow its partner to reposition or set up. Tera Grass is the safe option to boost G-Max Vine Lash and Sludge Bomb, but Tera Fire has become dominant because it removes Venusaur\u2019s Ice and Steel weaknesses and turns Weather Ball into a nuclear STAB that deletes the tier\u2019s premier sun checks\u2014Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur\u2014while still smiting Grass resists.

Revelation Dance is a 90 BP STAB that always matches Oricorio\u2019s primary type, so under Ghost it becomes a reliable spread Ghost hit that cleanly OHKOs Indeedee, Flutter Mane, and chipped Psychic-spam cores. Air Slash is chosen over Hurricane for accuracy and flinch chance, letting it fish for 30 % rolls versus slower targets after Tailwind. Tailwind itself is the reason to slot Oricorio over other Flying supports: it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame for four turns, enabling teammates like Volcarona or Sneasler to sweep immediately. The given EV spread hits 228 HP / 252 SpA / 20 Spe Modest; 20 EVs creep standard base 80 Scarfers such as Chien-Pao after Tailwind, while 228 HP guarantees surviving Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner into Sitrus recovery. Tera Fairy is the most common option, removing the Dark weakness and turning Oricorio into a pseudo-fairy that can stomach a Sucker Punch from Kingambit or Chien-Pao and retaliate with Revelation Dance. Tera Dark is a distant second, primarily used to block Prankster Taunt and to flip the match-up versus Indeedee\u2013Armarouge psychic terrain, but the Fairy route\u2019s defensive value is usually superior.</OUTPUT>"

Choice Specs variants (52% of teams) trade locking into one move for immediate wall-breaking, while Throat Spray sets (28%) prefer to set up on a Protect turn or after a partner\u2019s priority Follow Me, gaining +1 SpA and retaining move flexibility.

The two main spreads illustrate the speed control dilemma: Modest 252/204/52 maximizes damage and survives modest rolls from common Fairy and Flying attacks, whereas Timid 236/252 guarantees outspeeding positive-nature base 80s such as Chien-Pao and opposing Toxtricity.

Once the screens are up, every ally immediately becomes twice as bulky for five turns (eight with Light Clay), which in the current damage-heavy metagame often translates to one or two extra turns of setup or positioning. Dazzling Gleam gives Klefki a spread Fairy STAB that chips opposing Dragons and Dark-types while not triggering Contact-based punishments, and Misty Terrain offers team-wide status protection\u2014particularly useful against Spore, Sleep Powder, and Nuzzle users that would otherwise cripple Klefki\u2019s slower partners. The listed EV spreads (Calm 252 HP / 180 SpD or 252 HP / 156 SpD with leftover points in Defense) ensure Klefki survives strong special hits such as Flutter Mane\u2019s Shadow Ball or Chi-Yu\u2019s Overheat even without a screen, letting it fire off both barriers or pivot out with a switch. Terastallization into Ghost removes its Fighting weakness and makes it immune to Fake Out and Extreme Speed, while Tera Flying neutralizes Ground-type moves and grants a handy resistance to Grass; both forms are primarily used reactively to survive a KO or preserve a screen turn rather than to sweep. The complete absence of offensive items and the 100 % Prankster usage show that Klefki is a pure utility piece: it enters, sets up, chips or supports, and then either switches or sacrifices itself once its job is done.</OUTPUT>"

Detect over Protect is a minor optimization that avoids Imprison shenanigans from enemy Indeedee. Tera Ghost is preferred because it flips Close Combat, Bullet Punch, and Sucker Punch into immunities, letting Espeon stay on the field longer to fire off a second Expanding Force or a game-winning Shadow Ball. Stellar Tera is the greedy alternative: it boosts all moves once, breaks Tera-boosted resistances, and can secure surprise KOs on Ting-Lu or Kingambit that expect to live a resisted hit.

Incineroar loves Volt Switch because it can come in safely versus Fairies and begin Intimidate cycling; Rotom in turn welcomes Incineroar\u2019s Parting Shot to keep pivoting. Amoonguss forms a \u201cFerroCent\u201d-style core: Rotom handles Fire- and Steel-types for Amoonguss, while Amoonguss sponges Grass moves and puts threats to sleep, buying Rotom free turns.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Overqwil\u2019s stat line is deceptively well-suited to the current metagame: 85 HP / 95 Def / 65 SpD gives it enough physical bulk to survive -1 Gholdengo Make It Rain or a Life Orb Rillaboom Wood Hammer, while 85 Spe becomes 170 under Swift Swim\u2014enough to outpace +1 Roaring Moon, Choice Scarf Gholdengo and every relevant weather sweeper. Dark/Poison is a fantastic offensive combination, hitting every Tapu, Indeedee, Armarouge, Hatterene and Ogerpon for super-effective damage; defensively it packs only two weaknesses (Ground and Psychic) and four key resistances (Grass, Dark, Ghost, Poison) that allow it to pivot into Rillaboom, Basculegion and Sneasler with minimal chip. The ability distribution on the ladder shows 79 % Swift Swim, 19 % Intimidate and 2 % Poison Point, confirming that rain sweeping is its primary identity, but Intimidate variants are gaining traction on non-rain teams that simply want a bulky offensive Intimidate user that also scorns Fairy-types. Item-wise, Clear Amulet appears on ~45 % of recorded sets, preventing Attack drops from Intimidate, Parting Shot or Chilling Water and ensuring Liquidation and Gunk Shot retain full power; Choice Band (~35 %) is the other major option, giving Overqwil the immediate muscle to OHKO bulkless Flutter Mane and 2HKO max-HP Garganacl after Tera Water. The listed moves\u2014Throat Chop, Protect, Gunk Shot, Liquidation\u2014form the standard four-slot set: Liquidation is the spammable STAB that also procs rain boost, Gunk Shot nukes Fairies and Grass-types, Throat Chop blocks Follow Me, Helping Hand and TR-setting attempts from the likes of Indeedee-F and Armarouge, and Protect is mandatory for doubles play. Tera Water is preferred because it strengthens Liquidation and removes the Ground weakness, letting Overqwil survive Great Tusk Headlong Rush or Landorus-T Earth Power and retaliate. Tera Dark is taken when teams need a stronger Throat Chop breakpoint (e.g. OHKOing offensive Calyrex-I through Reflect), while Tera Normal grants an immunity to Ghost-type moves and synergises with teammates running Ghost themselves to block Rapid Spin. Overqwil\u2019s synergy with Pelipper is obvious\u2014rain doubles its Speed and Liquidation power\u2014but it also appreciates Pelipper\u2019s U-turn and Tailwind support to gain positioning. Archaludon is the most common partner, forming a rain-based VoltTurn core: Archaludon baits Ground- and Fighting-types for Overqwil to threaten, while Overqwil lures Grass- and Fairy-types for Archaludon to obliterate with Electro Shot. Basculegion provides a second Swift Swim attacker that breaks physical walls like Corviknight and Dozo, while Rillaboom gives Grassy Glide priority and Fake Out support, patching up Overqwil\u2019s merely okay bulk with healing. Gholdengo offers a Ghost resist and late-game cleaning, and Sneasler supplies fast Poison Touch pressure that can stack status alongside Overqwil\u2019s Poison Point rolls. In practice, Overqwil functions as a mid-game breaker that can clean once its checks are weakened, or as an early-game pivot that trades favourably into common leads such as Indeedee-F + Armarouge or Rillaboom + Heatran. Its main drawbacks are a lack of reliable recovery, a 30 % miss chance on Gunk Shot, and the need for rain to truly shine, but proper team support mitigates these issues and turns Overqwil into a potent pocket pick that most opponents fail to respect.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Overqwil\u2019s match-up spread is polarised but powerful. Against rain-weak archetypes\u2014Sun, Sand, and most balanced builds\u2014it functions as a win-condition: under rain it outspeeds and OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Crown, Chi-Yu and offensive Landorus-T with Liquidation, while Gunk Shot picks off Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, Ogerpon-Wellspring and bulky Sylveon. It 2HKOes max-HP Garganacl after Tera Water and cleanly OHKOes offensive variants, making it one of the most reliable Garg answers available. Versus Trick Room, Throat Chop prevents Indeedee-F from setting up Psychic Terrain and Follow Me, and the 85 % flinch chance can force mind-games with Hatterene; if TR still goes up, Overqwil can survive a Life Orb Rage Powder from Amoonguss and KO back with Gunk Shot. Against opposing weather, Overqwil needs to be careful: Sun teams carry Torkoal Overheat andProtosynthesis Great Tusk Headlong Rush, both of which OHKO even through Tera Water, so it must either come in after a KO or rely on Pelipper\u2019s Tailwind to win the speed tie. Sand teams with Choice Scarf Garchomp are similarly problematic, though Overqwil can survive non-boosted Earthquake and KO back with Liquidation after chip. Into bulky offense, Overqwil\u2019s main hurdle is Corviknight, which avoids the 2HKO from Liquidation even after Tera Water; teams therefore run Basculegion or Specs Pelipper Hurricane to soften it first. vs. Screens or Booster Energy setups, Overqwil\u2019s speed tier under rain lets it snipe key threats before they move, but it dislikes Thunder Wave from Grimmsnarl or Zapdos and can be worn down by Rocky Helmet + Iron Barbs chip. Finally, Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F blocks priority Sucker Punch from Kingambit, which otherwise checks Overqwil, so terrain wars are a micro-game within the broader match-up.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Overqwil is best viewed as a Swift Swim wall-breaker and anti-meta Fairy slayer that can compress the roles of speed control, offensive Intimidate and late-game cleaner into one slot. On rain teams it is the secondary speed control behind Pelipper Tailwind, providing immediate offensive pressure that discourages opponents from staying in with their Fairy or Grass-type. On non-rain builds, Intimidate variants act as a bulky pivot that switches into Rillaboom, Basculegion and Kingambit, drops Attack, and threatens to KO or force switches with strong dual-STAB. Its speed tier is mediocre outside rain, so these teams tend to pair it with either Tailwind from Corviknight or paralysis support from Zapdos/Rotom-W to let it function. Regardless of weather, Overqwil\u2019s primary job is to remove or weaken the opponent\u2019s Fairy-type so that its teammates\u2014often Gholdengo, Archaludon or Basculegion\u2014can sweep unimpeded. It also serves as a soft check to physical set-up sweepers such as Swords Dance Kingambit and Dragon Dance Baxcalibur thanks to Intimidate and the ability to tank a hit and KO back. Because it carries Protect, it can stall Dynamon turns or delay Tailwind expiration, giving its team tempo advantages. In the late game, once Ground- and Psychic-types are eliminated, Overqwil becomes a bona-fide sweeper under rain, outspeeding everything except Choice Scarf Dragapult and OHKOing most neutral targets with Liquidation. Its role is therefore flexible: early-game pivot, mid-game breaker, or late-game cleaner depending on team composition and opposing board state.</OUTPUT>"

Ground-type moves are the most direct answer: Great Tusk Headlong Rush, Landorus-T Earth Power and Garchomp Earthquake all OHKO even through Tera Water if rain is not up, so keeping Pelipper alive is paramount. Psychic-types also threaten it: Indeedee-F Expanding Force in terrain and Choice Specs Tapu Lele Psychic are guaranteed OHKOs, though both must be wary of switching into Gunk Shot. Bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight and Celesteela avoid the 2HKO from Liquidation and can stall out rain with Roost + Iron Defense, or retaliate with Body Press. Status cripples Overqwil: burns from Rotom-W or Zapdos halve its Attack, while paralysis from Grimmsnarl Thunder Wave removes its speed advantage under rain. Priority moves like Kingambit Sucker Punch or Chien-Pao Ice Shard can finish it after chip, though Psychic Terrain blocks the former.

Dragon/Steel is a defensively stacked typing that resists every type except the rare Fairy, Fighting, and Ground, but it also saddles Goodra with a crippling 4\u00d7 weakness to the ever-present Iron Valiant and Iron Hands. Sap Sipper flips the script on Grass-type offense, turning Rillaboom\u2019s U-turn or Amooguss\u2019s Spore into +1 Attack boosts that immediately transform Goodra into a Body Press threat. Acid Armor is the crux of the set, skyrocketing its already titanic Defense to +2 in a single turn and letting Body Press hit 120 BP off a stat that can reach 400+ after boosts. Protect and Life Dew complete the stall package, letting Goodra block double-target pressure and heal both itself and its ally for 25% in a format where passive recovery is scarce. Leftovers is the only item shown with any frequency, synergizing with Life Dew to create incremental recovery that can outlast opposing damage output. The absence of offensive move data implies that Goodra relies entirely on Body Press and ally chip to score KOs, making it a true team-support tank rather than a standalone win condition. Its Speed tier is intentionally low, letting it move last to enable ally redirection or speed-control setups, and its Tera options are conservative: Water removes one of its two 4\u00d7 weaknesses (Fire) and adds useful Ground resistance, while Ghost offers immunity to Fake Out and Extreme Speed, two of the most common forms of priority that break through Protect. Despite these strengths, Goodra\u2019s passivity and need for multiple setup turns relegate it to a niche role on squads that already possess overwhelming offensive pressure elsewhere.</OUTPUT>"

Amoonguss provides redirection and Spore support, letting Goodra set up Acid Armor freely; likewise, Goodra switches into Grass-type attacks aimed at Amoonguss. Gholdengo punishes opposing status and spreads hazard chip, while Goodra tanks Fighting- and Dark-type moves for it. Volcarona offers fast offensive pressure and appreciates Goodra\u2019s ability to stall Dynamax turns with Protect, letting it set up Quiver Dance later.

By halving any special damage taken, Frosmoth can comfortably set up Quiver Dance in front of special attackers that would obliterate most other setup sweepers. After a single dance, its Special Attack and Special Defense skyrocket to astronomical levels, while its Speed becomes serviceable against slower boards. The chosen item defines its setup window: Covert Cloak blocks fake-out and secondary effects such as Moonblast drops or Sludge Bomb poison, Sitrus provides a one-off 25 % heal to survive a physical hit, and Leftovers offers gradual recovery that synergizes with Protect stalling. The two listed spreads illustrate the dichotomy: the 116 HP / 236 Def / 148 Spe Timid variant hits 143 Speed, outspeeding max-speed Dragapult and +1 base 100s after a dance, turning Frosmoth into a late-game cleaner. Conversely, the 212 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe Modest spread lives Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and Timid Life Orb Dragon Pulse from Dragapult, making it a mid-game wallbreaker that can trade with physical attackers after chip. Tera Dragon is the optimal choice, removing the crippling Fire weakness and granting a neutral matchup into Steel-types that otherwise wall STAB Ice/Bug. Tera Water and Electric are situational, offering different defensive profiles against Sun or Electric Terrain teams respectively. The moveset is non-negotiable: Quiver Dance is the win condition, Ice Beam and Bug Buzz provide perfect neutral coverage barring Tera Fire Steel-types, and Protect is essential for double-target mind games and gaining Leftovers recovery. Frosmoth\u2019s success hinges on teammate support: Incineroar provides Intimidate and Parting Shot to buy turns; Alolan Ninetales sets Aurora Veil and brings Snow, enabling 100 % accurate Blizzards if Frosmoth opts for it; Primarina and Dragapult offer immediate special pressure to soften shared checks; Meowscarada gives Grass coverage and Flower Trick for Calyrex-I; Coalossal sets sun for Moonlight-boosted Weather Ball or simply provides a physical tank that appreciates special walls.

Volt Absorb is preferred for healing off chip from U-turn or allied Discharge, but Quick Feet can punish status teams if you drop Covert Cloak for a status orb. Covert Cloak is the default item because it blanks secondary effects from Icy Wind, Snarl, and Lava Plume, letting Jolteon stay on the field longer than Focus Sash variants. Fake Tears plus a spread special attacker such as Sylveon or Espeon can score OHKOs on bulky titans like Garganacl or Dondozo, while Eerie Impulse neuters physical setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite or Swords Dance Chien-Pao. Thunder Wave provides blanket speed control that lets slower sweepers like Flareon or Vaporeon move first next turn. Tera Ghost blocks Fake Out and Extreme Speed, granting a free pivot or setup turn, whereas Tera Flying removes the Ground weakness so Jolteon can stay in on Landorus-T or Great Tusk and continue supporting. The Eevee-evolution core synergy is strong: Vaporeon provides Wish and Heal Bell, Umbreon offers Fake Out and Taunt, Sylveon brings Hyper Voice spam, and Flareon supplies physical pressure; together they overload the opponent\u2019s targeting priorities and let Jolteon pick its spots to disrupt.</OUTPUT>"

After a single Iron Defense its Defense stat reaches a titanic 656, meaning even super-effective contact moves fail to break the Sitrus Berry threshold. Earth Eater is the cornerstone of its viability; Ground is one of the most spammable offensive types in VGC, and gaining a free 25 % heal on every predicted Earthquake or Tera Ground move flips the risk-reward entirely. Opponents are forced to double-target Orthworm with special attacks or commit to Grass, Water or Fire coverage, all of which are telegraphed and exploitable. Tera Fire is used on 61 % of ladder teams because it removes the 4\u00d7 Fire weakness and turns Orthworm into a soft check to Sun staples like Torkoal and Iron Moth; after Terastallizing it resists both of their STABs and can retaliate with Heavy Slam or continue to cycle Iron Defense. The chosen EV spread is mathematically optimized for the current damage calculator: 252 HP / 116 Def / 132 SpD with an Impish nature guarantees survival against the most common physical threats while still letting Shed Tail outrun uninvested base 70s such as opposing Tyranitar and Incineroar. Offensively Orthworm is mediocre\u2014base 70 Attack and no boosting item mean Heavy Slam will not OHKO anything relevant, but Body Press uses the +2 Defense stat as its base power, turning Orthworm into a 140+ BP Fighting nuke that cleanly OHKOs Kingambit, Tyranitar and Garganacl after one Iron Defense. Shed Tail is the move that justifies its inclusion: passing a 50 % max-HP substitute to a slow but dangerous teammate like Dragonite or Ursaluna is equivalent to gaining a free Protect plus a 50 % HP buffer, which almost always translates into a KO or a second setup turn. The downside is that Orthworm is setup fodder for special attackers like Iron Valiant, Hydreigon and Flutter Mane, and it folds instantly to Taunt or Encore. Therefore successful Orthworm teams build in answers to these problems\u2014Indeedee-F for Fake Out and priority blocking, Incineroar for Parting Shot and Intimidate, or Tyranitar for Sand chip and special bulk. In best-of-three formats Orthworm is brought only on previews where the opponent is overloaded with physical Ground or Fighting attackers; in game-one blind teams it is usually benched unless the pilot is confident in the lead read. Overall Orthworm is a matchup fish that, when scripted correctly, can single-handedly dismantle standard physical offense cores while creating the most efficient pivoting in the format.</OUTPUT>"

It also walls Kingambit, Scizor and Bisharp, because +2 Defense Body Press OHKOs them while they cannot score the 2HKO back. Against Dragonite, Orthworm survives +1 Tera Normal Extreme Speed and retaliates with Heavy Slam or sets up a second Iron Defense, forcing a Tera commit or a switch. On the flip side, special attackers are nightmarish: Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, Hydreigon, Iron Moth and Sylveon all OHKO or 2HKO with their respective STABs before Orthworm can act. Taunt users such as Murkrow, Whimsicott or opposing Incineroar completely shut down the Iron Defense cycle and force early Shed Tail, costing momentum. Sun teams can overwhelm it with Torkoal Eruption or Charizard Blast Burn, although Tera Fire mitigates one of these threats. Rain is similarly rough, as Specs Pelipper Hurricane or Barraskewda Liquidation are guaranteed KOs. Trick Room variants that rely on special breakers like Hatterene or Armarouge also invalidate Orthworm, because it cannot underspeed them to pivot. Finally, Encore from Indeedee-F or Whimsicott locks Orthworm into Iron Defense or Shed Tail and turns it into passive setup fodder.

In team preview it is brought only when the opponent\u2019s fastest physical attacker cannot break +1 Defense and when the rest of the squad benefits from a free pivot turn. During the game it operates on a simple flowchart: turn-one Iron Defense if the opponent cannot 2HKO, turn-two either Body Press for the KO or Shed Tail to the designated breaker if the KO is impossible. Tera Fire is used reactively to check Sun or to survive a Fire-type coverage move, never pre-emptively unless the win condition demands it. Because Orthworm is slower than most support Pok\u00e9mon, it is often paired with Indeedee-F to block Fake Out and priority, ensuring the Iron Defense goes up unscathed. Once Shed Tail is executed, Orthworm\u2019s job is done; it is sacrificed or used as a double-target decoy while the substitute recipient sets up. In endgame scenarios Orthworm can reverse-sweep if the opponent is left with only physical attackers and no Taunt, but this is rare.

With a 67 % usage of Rocky Helmet and a 21 % Leftovers share, it is clearly built to punish physical attackers while staying on the field long enough to fire off accurate Scalds, spread Yawns, and cripple special walls with Fake Tears. The near-unanimous choice of Grass Tera (72 %) alongside a smaller Fire Tera contingent (23 %) shows players value turning Vaporeon into either a Gastrodon-style Grass tank or a surprise anti-Grass/anti-Ice pivot. EV spreads overwhelmingly favour Bold 252 HP / 252 Def (67 %) to maximise physical bulk, while a minority run Modest 252 HP / 252 SpA (19 %) to push immediate damage. Water Absorb is the ability of choice (85 %), giving free switches into partner Water moves and turning common Scald or Surf users into recovery opportunities. Detect, Scald, Yawn, and Fake Tears form the standard moveset, giving Vaporeon a rare blend of chip damage, burn chance, forced switches, and special support. Its most common partners are the entire Eeveelution squad\u2014Umbreon, Sylveon, Espeon, Jolteon, and Flareon\u2014plus Annihilape, suggesting Vaporeon is most comfortable on full-team gimmick or \u201cEevee-hero\u201d cores where multiple Wish-passers and bulky pivots wear the opponent down while maintaining field control.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Vaporeon\u2019s stat distribution is the classic bulky Water archetype taken to extremes: 130/60/95 bulk on the special side is excellent, but its 65 base Defense means it absolutely needs investment and, ideally, Rocky Helmet chip to check physical threats. The Bold max-Def spread patches the weaker defence while letting Scald threaten burn, whereas the Modest spread sacrifices some longevity to turn Fake Tears and Scald into genuine offensive pressure. Water Absorb is the star ability, turning opposing Rain teams or incidental Surfs into 25 % healing; Hydration remains a fringe option (0.3 %) that could be paired with Rain for status-clearing, but the opportunity cost is enormous. Tera Grass is the clear favourite because it removes Electric weakness, cushions Grass and Water hits, and flips the mirror match against opposing Waters; Tera Fire is a tech to survive Freeze-Dry from Rotom-W or Iron Bundle and retaliate with a burn-chance Scald. Yawn is the move that gives Vaporeon real influence: behind Follow Me or with a partner that threatens spread damage, Yawn forces Protects or switches, buying free turns for setup or positioning. Fake Tears is the other unique selling point\u2014dropping both foes\u2019 Special Defense by two stages in doubles turns Vaporeon into a special \u201cenabler,\u201d letting partners such as Sylveon, Espeon, or even Annihilape\u2019s Final Gambit secure KOs they would otherwise miss. Detect is non-negotiable for survival and Leftovers/Rocky Helmet stalling, while Scald is the obligatory STAB with the ever-valuable 30 % burn chance. EV spreads are almost always 252/252 in the two key stats, with the last 4 placed in the unused attacking stat to minimise Foul Play/ confusion damage. In short, Vaporeon offers a mix of pivoting, passive damage, and special support that few other Water-types can replicate in the current VGC environment.</OUTPUT>"

Parting Shot is the marquee move: a -1 Atk / -1 Sp.Atk debuff plus guaranteed pivot that no other fast supporter in the format possesses. Tailwind gives your side a four-turn speed advantage, while Brave Bird is a passable 120 BP STAB that prevents Squawkabilly from being complete deadweight under Taunt or after a KO. U-turn supplies a secondary pivot option that preserves momentum when Parting Shot\u2019s stat drops are undesirable (e.g. versus Defiant or Competitive users). Maximum Speed and Attack with a Jolly nature are non-negotiable to speed-tie opposing Scarfers at 110 and to secure key KOs on frail threats like Flutter Mane after chip.

Protect is mandatory for prediction and to preserve Focus Sash or Poison Heal recovery.  The item split shows two philosophies: Focus Sash guarantees at least one Spore or Bullet Seed, while Iron Ball on a Brave set lets it move last inside Trick Room and adds a 130-base-power Ground move to its spread through Fling, giving it a surprise tech against Toxapex, Heatran and Miraidon.

Harvest gives a 50% recycle chance per turn, effectively granting a 50% chance to heal 25% every turn after consuming Sitrus; when combined with Focus Sash (60% usage) the tree becomes surprisingly hard to remove turn 1, while Life Orb variants (22%) trade bulk for immediate power. Modest max Special Attack is non-negotiable\u2014base 125 SpA is the highest among legal Psychic-types that can also set Trick Room, giving it a damage ceiling high enough to 2HKO neutral targets like Tornadus-I and bulky Gholdengo through terrain. Expanding Force under terrain reaches 120 BP spread damage without the accuracy issues of Heat Wave or Rock Slide, allowing Exeggutor to pressure both foes simultaneously while partner Indeedee-F provides Follow Me and terrain insurance. Energy Ball is primarily used to smack Gastrodon and Rotom-Wash for ~70%, forcing Protect or Tera, while Sleep Powder punches holes in stall cores and can buy a free Harvest recycle. Psychic Tera turns its STAB into a nuke (effectively 180 BP spread) and removes Dark weakness, letting it stay on the field against Kingambit or Tera-Dark mons. The 39% 0-Atk/4-Def spread is chosen to survive Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner + Ice Shard 100% of the time after Sitrus, while the 34% 4-HP variant guarantees the same versus Adamant Life Orb Chien-Pao.

Mental Herb is the default item: it guarantees Trick Room goes up against Taunt users like Murkrow or Whimsicott, while Leftovers is a distant second choice for longer stalling. The listed spread (Relaxed 252/0/132/0/124/0) maximises overall physical bulk, outslows every non-TR Pok\u00e9mon under sun, and hits a Leftovers number. Trick Room is the mandatory speed control, Iron Defense + Body Press the win-condition engine, and Ice Spinner the coverage slot: it 2HKOs common Dragons (Dragapult, Flutter Mane) and breaks Psychic Terrain so partners can spam priority. Fire Tera is ubiquitous because it flips the Fire weakness into a resistance, letting Bronzong survive Overheat from Torkoal or Heat Wave from Charizard and retaliate with a +2 Body Press.</OUTPUT>"

The Roar set is unique: it is one of the few physically oriented Fire-types that can deny Trick Room without sacrificing momentum, making it a specialist pick versus hard-room squads. Because its bulk is insufficient to take more than one neutral hit, Flareon must be paired with speed control (Tailwind, Electroweb, Icy Wind) or defensive support (Veil, Intimidate, Friend Guard) to ensure it attacks first or survives the retaliation. Its low Speed tier also means it functions as a pseudo-TR deterrent: opponents often avoid setting Room if they suspect Roar, giving the Flareon player tempo.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Poison Heal is the engine that makes Gliscor viable in Doubles: once Toxic Orb activates it recovers 12.5% every turn, effectively giving it a Leftovers that stacks with Protect and cannot be removed by Knock Off. This allows Gliscor to sit on the field for extended periods, clicking Swords Dance while partner Pok\u00e9mon set Tailwind or Aurora Veil. Dual Wingbeat is chosen over Acrobatics to guarantee two hits through Focus Sash and because the item slot is locked to Toxic Orb; the multi-hit also breaks Mimikyu\u2019s Disguise and deals solid damage to Rillaboom and Amoonguss after a boost. High Horsepower is the obligatory Ground STAB, nailing Gholdengo, Torkoal and Heatran for OHKOs at +2 and providing spread damage that does not make contact, dodging Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs chip. Protect is mandatory in doubles to stall turns of speed control, weather, or Dynamon pressure while Poison Heal continues to restore health. The chosen EV spreads reflect two philosophies: the Adamant 252/36/4/0/196/20 spread maximizes immediate power while still outspeeding Timid Gholdengo after a Tailwind, whereas the Careful 244/20/0/0/220/20 spread sacrifices some Attack for special bulk, letting Gliscor survive Life Orb Tornadus-T Hurricane or Choice Specs Tapu Fini Moonblast and retaliate. Tera Water is overwhelmingly preferred because it flips the 4\u00d7 Ice weakness into a resistance, letting Gliscor live Choice Specs Kyurem Ice Beam or Tera Ice Dragonite Extreme Speed and roost off the damage; Tera Normal is a secondary option to give Extreme Speed immunity and boost Facade if running it, but the moveset data shows no Facade usage, so Water remains optimal. Gliscor fits best on mid-speed teams that appreciate a bulky win-condition able to operate under both Tailwind and Trick Room, and its teammates reflect this: Rillaboom supplies priority Grassy Glide and removes opposing terrain, Talonflame offers fast Tailwind and priority support, Gholdengo pressures Fairy-types and blocks Defog, Grimmsnarl sets screens and taunts opposing setup, Ninetales-A sets Aurora Veil and provides Snow warning chip, and Garchomp forms a potent Ground-spam core that can overwhelm shared checks like Corviknight or Rotom-Wash.</OUTPUT>"

Trick Room teams that rely on passive damage\u2014such as Galarian Corsola or Porygon2\u2014are similarly dismantled by constant Poison Heal recovery and Swords Dance pressure. Conversely, fast Ice-type offense remains the biggest obstacle: Choice Specs Kyurem, Tera Ice Iron Valiant, or Tera Ice Chien-Pao all outspeed and OHKO before Gliscor can move unless Tailwind is up. Opposing Intimidate cycles also slow the setup: Landorus-T and Incineroar force Gliscor into Swords Dance loops that give the opponent time to reposition.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Houndstone's metagame footprint is defined by Last Respects, the only move in doubles that scales off the number of total fainted Pok\u00e9mon (friend and foe). At full health it is a respectable 50 BP, but after four total faints it surpasses 200 BP and after six it reaches 350 BP\u2014out-damaging even Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan's Icicle Crash. Adamant 252/252 spreads are omnipresent because outspeeding key threats such as Iron Valiant, opposing Houndstone, and Chien-Pao is crucial; the leftover EVs are usually dropped into Special Defense to survive a Timid Flutter Mane Moonblast after sand chip. Sand Rush is preferred on most teams since doubling speed under sand turns Houndstone into a pseudo-scarf attacker that can still switch moves, while Fluffy offers a defensive pivot option that punishes contact attackers like Garchomp and Iron Hands. Life Orb is the default for maximum damage, but Assault Vest variants are rising to stomach Flutter Mane Shadow Ball and Iron Bundle Hydro Pump while still 2HKOing most of the tier. Protect is mandatory to stall Dynamax turns, dodge double-targets, and wait for an ally to drop so Last Respects spikes. Shadow Sneak gives priority to finish weakened sash holders or opposing Houndstone mirrors, and Snarl provides special utility versus Calyrex-I, Miraidon, and Indeedee. Tera Ghost is the most straightforward route, turning Shadow Sneak into a 120 BP priority and Last Respects into a nuclear 525 BP (after five faints) that cleanly OHKOs max-HP Toxapex and Corviknight. Tera Fairy is increasingly popular to survive Sucker Punch from Kingambit, resist Knock Off from Incineroar, and avoid Shadow Rex's Astral Barrage, while Tera Water grants a crucial neutrality to Garchomp's Earthquake and Iron Moth's Heat Wave. The Pok\u00e9mon is not without flaws: it is completely shut down by Follow Me / Rage Powder users unless its ally carries Taunt or Fake Out, and it folds to any form of speed control that negates Sand Rush\u2014Tailwind, Trick Room, or priority paralysis. Nevertheless, when supported by sand, revival, and a path to four or more total KOs, Houndstone becomes one of the most efficient closing sweepers in the current Regulation G doubles environment.</OUTPUT>"

Against offense it excels\u2014teams trading KO for KO accelerate its damage curve and sand chip plus Shadow Sneak picks off Focus Sash holders. Into bulkier stall or Follow Me cores it struggles hard; Indeedee-F + Armarouge or Togekiss + Garchomp can redirect and set Trick Room or Tailwind, nullifying Sand Rush and forcing Houndstone to become passive. It wins the one-on-one versus most Ghost-types bar bulky Skeledirge, but loses to priority Sucker Punch from Kingambit and Bisharp, and to Shadow Sneak from opposing Houndstone if slower. Flutter Mane is a 50/50: scarf variants outspeed and OHKO, while sand Rush variants KO back with +1 Last Respects after one faint. Rain teams are problematic because Pelipper removes sand and Swift Swim Barraskewda or Floatzel outspeed and KO. Sun teams are more manageable\u2014Torkoal removes sand but is slower, and Houndstone can Tera Water to survive Eruption and KO back. In the mirror, the player who controls sand and gets the first faint usually wins; Protect mind-games and Shadow Sneak become vital. Overall, Houndstone prefers to face hyper-offense or balance squads that trade KOs early; it despises redirection, speed control, and weather wars it cannot win.</OUTPUT>"

Because the move scales with total faints, Houndstone is perfectly happy to see its own partner drop, making it one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that actively benefits from trading one-for-one. Shadow Sneak gives it a soft presence versus sash and chip damage before it begins its sweep, while Snarl lets it contribute versus special attackers if the gamestate is not yet ripe for the sweep. Protect is the glue that buys the crucial turn for another ally to faint or for sand chip to secure a KO. In some compositions Houndstone can operate as an Assault Vest pivot that switches in on predicted Ghost- or Dark-type attacks directed at its sand setter, tanking the hit and firing off a still-respectable 100\u2013150 BP Last Respects.

Garchomp is a secondary setter that threatens opposing Tyranitar and provides Ground-immune momentum, while its Rough Skin + Rocky Helmet punishes contact attackers and speeds up the faint clock.

Leaf Storm\u2019s self-inflicted -2 becomes +2, so after a single attack Serperior reaches +2, after the second +4, and so on, quickly out-damaging even restricted Pok\u00e9mon. 108 base Speed with a Timid nature and 252 EVs hits 167, outspeeding positive-nature base 90s such as Kyogre, Groudon, and base 95s like Urshifu while also edging out neutral-nature Flutter Mane under Tailwind. 140 HP EVs with 36 Def and 20 SpD give specific calcs: it always survives Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao Ice Spinner, Modest Gholdengo Make It Rain, and has a good shot vs.-1 Sun-boosted Torkoal Overheat after Tera Stellar. Glare is the glue: 100 % accurate paralysis that halves Speed and creates 25 % full-paralysis odds, neutering threats like opposing Koraidon, Miraidon, or Kingambit that would otherwise set up or retaliate. Protect is mandatory for doubles, scouting choice-locked moves and gaining Leftovers recovery. The fourth slot is almost always Terablast: Tera Stellar turns Terablast into a 120 BP move that hits everything neutrally, giving Serperior a spammable option once it has racked up boosts and wants to avoid Grass-resistant targets. Alternatively, Tera Fire Terablast OHKOs standard Amoonguss and deals heavy damage to Corviknight and Gholdengo while also letting Serperior absorb Will-o-Wisp. Itemization is meta-dependent: Leftovers offsets Stealth Rock chip and incidental damage, Covert Cloak prevents Fake Out flinch and ignores SpA drops from moves like Snarl or Make It Rain, while Miracle Seed secures the first Leaf Storm KO on bulky waters like Toxapex or opposing Rillaboom. EV spreads are surprisingly rigid because Speed ties are everything; the listed spread is on 16 % of uploaded teams, indicating a community consensus. Serperior\u2019s average usage sits around 6-7 % on Battle Stadium ladder, but spikes during grass-weak or speed-control metas, and it has top-cut multiple Regionals throughout Regulation G.</OUTPUT>"

Protect is mandatory for doubles timing, stalling out speed control or weather turns. Tera Steel is chosen on 93 % of sets because it removes the Fire weakness entirely, adds a crucial Toxic immunity, and gives a handy resistance to common Dragon and Fairy moves while preserving the Body Press synergy. The two listed spreads both run Bold nature and heavy Defense; the first (220 HP / 252 Def / 36 SpD) maximizes physical bulk, while the second trades 80 Def EVs for 76 Speed EVs to creep uninvested base 70s such as Kingambit and opposing support Pok\u00e9mon. Leftovers is the only item with meaningful usage, offering passive recovery that synergises with Dachsbun\u2019s stalling and pivoting role. The extremely low usage numbers indicate that the meta has not yet committed to optimising Dachsbun, but the consistent teammate choices show a clear game-plan: pair it with sun or slow pivot cores that appreciate Fire-immunity, Intimimate protection (Aroma Veil is present but almost unused), and Helping Hand damage amplification.</OUTPUT>"

Covert Cloak is the default item because it prevents Serene Grace Iron Head flinches, Nuzzle paralysis, and Garganacl Salt Cure chip, preserving Mandibuzz\u2019s capacity to click support moves every turn. Weakness Policy variants are usually paired with self-proc options like partner Rock Slide or Garchomp Earthquake; at +2, Foul Play reaches comical levels of power, 2HKOing even max-def Toxapex through Tera Fairy. Tera Ghost is the safest general option, removing the ubiquitous weakness to Ghost- and Dark-type STAB while preserving the Flying typing\u2019s Ground immunity, and making Mandibuzz immune to Fake Out and Extreme Speed. Tera Fighting is chosen specifically on teams that need a Rock resist and want to punish predicted Stone Edges; it also flips the Stealth Rock matchup from 25% to 6%, giving Mandibuzz far more switch-in opportunities over a long game. Mandibuzz\u2019s average damage output is its primary limitation, so it is almost never the win condition; instead it enables breakers by controlling the tempo of the game, forcing double-targets, and providing safe pivot points.</OUTPUT>"

Into Tailwind mirrors Mandibuzz often becomes a Snarl war; the bulkier spread usually wins because it can Roost more freely. Against Trick Room Mandibuzz is less impressive: although it underspeeds most setters, its inability to OHKO Hatterene or Indeedee-F means it has to rely on partner pressure or Taunt users, neither of which is guaranteed. Into stall or semi-stall Mandibuzz becomes a long-term win condition by repeatedly Roosting and removing hazards with a partner, but it must watch for Toxic from Toxapex and Gliscor, and Salt Cure from Garganacl\u2014Covert Cloak variants ignore the latter, but still fear the former. Notably, Mandibuzz is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that can consistently 1v1 Gholdengo because it resists both STABs, ignores Good as Gold with Roost, and 2HKOes back with Foul Play while healing off Shadow Ball damage. Into Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant Mandibuzz is shakier: it survives +1 Tera Fighting Sacred Sword but risks the 2HKO from Tera Dark Knock Off, so it must either Tera Ghost preemptively or rely on partner Intimidate. Finally, against rain teams Mandibuzz\u2019s Flying typing is a mixed blessing: it ignores Thunder Wave but takes 25% from Stealth Rock and fears Hurricane, so it prefers to Tailwind early and pivot out rather than attempt long wars.</OUTPUT>"

Base 123 Speed lets it outrun the crowded 110\u2013120 tier, firing off a first-turn Tailwind or an immediate Taunt to block opposing setup. Super Fang is the set\u2019s headline tech, shaving 50 % off any non-Ghost target to soften bulky cores for its teammates, while Air Slash gives it a spammable Flying STAB with flinch potential. Telepathy is the preferred ability on this analysis\u2019s data, letting Noivern stand beside spread attackers such as Gholdengo or Bloodmoon Ursaluna without fear of friendly fire. A Timid nature and heavy Speed EVs (236+) ensure it sets up before most threats, while the leftover bulk (140 Def or 100 HP) lets it survive a neutral Rock Slide or Ice Spinner to keep Tailwind on the field. Tera Ghost is the most common option, granting spin-blocking utility and a Normal-immune typing that flips Fake Out and Extreme Speed match-ups; Tera Steel is a close second, patching up the Ice, Rock, and Fairy weaknesses while keeping Noivern on the field against Sylveon and Chien-Pao. Covert Cloak is rising in popularity to ignore Amoonguss\u2019s Spore and Rage Powder, while Focus Sash remains a reliable one-time safety net. In the current metagame, Noivern fits best on bulky-offense cores that appreciate speed control and softening, pairing especially well with Gholdengo, Incineroar, and Amoonguss to create a disruptive Fake Out + redirection shell that lets Super Fang and heavy hitters such as Basculegion or Sneasler clean up.</OUTPUT>"

The special attack is merely adequate, but the Speed tier is exceptional\u2014outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame bar Regieleki and Talonflame. This allows Noivern to function as a hybrid support that always moves first, a rare trait among non-Prankster users. Telepathy is the standout ability here; with spread moves everywhere\u2014Earthquake, Dazzling Gleam, Make It Rain\u2014Noivern can position beside its partners without chip, preserving Focus Sash or Covert Cloak procs. The movepool is thin but surgical: Tailwind is mandatory speed control; Taunt prevents Trick Room, Aurora Veil, and Amoonguss shenanigans; Super Fang is the most spammable damage option in doubles, turning every switch-in into 50 % range; Air Slash provides Flying STAB and 30 % flinch chance to fish for luck. EV spreads cluster around two philosophies: 236 Speed Timid hits 200 Speed at level 50, outspeeding +1 neutral Kingambit and Jolly Chien-Pao; 124 HP / 140 Def guarantees survival against Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and modest Gholdengo Shadow Ball. Covert Cloak usage is rising precisely because Amoonguss is everywhere: Cloak ignores not only Spore but also Rage Powder, letting Noivern Taunt or Tailwind straight through redirection. Tera Ghost is the most frequent choice, removing Fake Out vulnerability and providing an immunity to Extreme Speed and Normal-type STAB, both of which plague Noivern\u2019s teammates. Tera Steel is the defensive alternative, turning the 4x Ice and 2x Rock weaknesses into neutral hits and granting a crucial Fairy resistance so Noivern can live Choice Specs Sylveon Hyper Voice and retaliate with Super Fang or Air Slash. The rise of Ghost- and Steel-tera also synergizes with Gholdengo, forming a double Ghost or double Steel core that punits opposing Poison- and Fire-type coverage.

Against hard Trick Room, turn-one Taunt can seal the mode entirely, forcing Indeedee/Hatterene to play a guessing game. Versus sun or rain, Tailwind immediately flips the speed bracket, letting Noivern\u2019s side outspeed +1 Swift Swim or +2 Chlorophyll sweepers. Super Fang is universally effective: it cripples Dondozo, Ting-Lu, and Iron Hands in one click, turning 3-hit KO scenarios into 2-hit ones for its allies. Against opposing Tailwind or speed-control mirrors, Noivern\u2019s base 123 Speed plus Timid nature means it almost always moves first, allowing it to reset or block opposing Tailwind. However, Noivern folds to faster priority or specially bulky attackers. Choice Scarf Chien-Pao, Talonflame, and Regieleki all outspeed and OHKO with Ice Spinner, Brave Bird, or Thunderbolt respectively. Priority users such as Dragonite Extreme Speed or Kingambit Sucker Punch can finish off chipped Noivern, though Tera Ghost blanks Extreme Speed. Amoonguss remains a soft check\u2014while Covert Cloak ignores Spore, Sludge Bomb still 2HKOes and Clear Smog removes Tailwind. Wide Guard users like Araquanid or Iron Bundle can stall Tailwind turns, while Fake Out pressure from Incineroar or Maushold can break Sash and force 2-on-1 scenarios. Opposing Steel-types (Kingambit, Gholdengo) resist Air Slash and ignore Super Fang if Terastallized into Steel, so Noivern must rely on teammates to break them.

It leads in approximately 70 % of games to fire off an immediate Tailwind or Taunt, then either pivots out or stays to spam Super Fang. Because Super Fang is percentage-based, Noivern remains relevant at every stage of the game: early-game it cripples bulky setup, mid-game it breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy, and late-game it secures range for priority or speed-boosted sweepers. Telepathy lets it partner safely with Earthquake Garchomp, Make It Rain Gholdengo, or Bloodmoon Ursaluna, turning Noivern into a glue piece that enables spread offense without self-damage. The Timid 236 Speed spread guarantees it outruns the entire unboosted metagame except Regieleki and Talonflame, giving its team an immediate speed advantage that forces opponents to play reactively. In the back, Noivern can reverse-sweep with Tailwind plus Air Slash flinches, but its low offensive stats mean it usually cements its value through positioning and chip rather than KOing. Tera Ghost or Steel is used reactively: Ghost to blank Fake Out and Extreme Speed, Steel to survive Ice- and Fairy-type coverage and preserve Tailwind.

Incineroar provides Fake Out and Intimidate, letting Noivern set Tailwind safely while Super Fang softens targets for Darkest Lariat or Flare Blitz. Amoonguss forms a redirection core: Rage Powder draws attacks away from Noivern, while Telepathy means Noivern ignores Sludge Bomb friendly fire; in return Noivern Taunts opposing Amoonguss to prevent Spore. Sneasler and Bloodmoon Ursaluna appreciate the speed control and 50 % chip: Super Fang puts virtually everything into +1 Sneasler Dire Claw or Blood Moon range, while Tailwind lets them outspeed Scarfers. Basculegion enjoys Ghost-tera synergy and pseudo-STAB spread with Tailwind, turning Shadow Ball into a 140 BP Last Respects-style nuke. Covert Cloak Noivern also pairs well with bulky setup like Calm Mind Gholdengo or Swords Dance Kingambit, since it can ignore Amoonguss and buy setup turns with Taunt.

The 164 Speed EVs creep to 135, outspeeding uninvested base 70s and slower support such as Amoonguss and Ting-Lu. Grassy Glide is the star move: under ally Rillaboom terrain it becomes a 120 bp Grass-type priority that cleanly OHKOes neutral targets like offensive Landorus-T, Kingambit and Ogerpon-Wellspring. Drain Punch covers Ferrothorn, Gholdengo and opposing Rillaboom while healing ~50 % HP on a KO, allowing multiple boosts in a single game. Spiky Shield is invaluable in doubles: it protects the sweep, racks chip on U-turn/Incineroar Fake Out, and denies opposing Grassy Glide mirrors by forcing them to target the partner. Bulletproof is the ability of choice, turning Chesnaught into a hard counter to Gholdengo, Iron Valiant, and Indeedee-F because it blocks Shadow Ball, Aura Sphere, Focus Blast and Pollen Puff; Overgrow is technically legal but functionally useless once Sitrus is consumed. The Tera decision is matchup dependent: Tera Fire removes both 4\u00d7 weaknesses and leaves only a single Rock weakness, letting it survive Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle and Tornadus; Tera Steel keeps STAB on Glide and grants a Fairy resistance plus Toxic immunity, useful against Sylveon and support Grimmsnarl. Either way, the transformation should be telegraphed to the opponent only after the Drum is up, ensuring maximum surprise value. Chesnaught fits best on semi-room or tempo squads that can provide either speed control (Electroweb, Icy Wind) or terrain refresh, and it appreciates Fake Out or Follow Me to guarantee the setup turn.</OUTPUT>"

Against faster hyper-offense the mu is more nuanced: it can\u2019t safely drum in front of Specs Dragapult or Chien-Pao, but a well-timed Tera Fire lets it tank an Icicle Crash and KO back with Glide. Flying-type restricteds such as Tornadus and Zapdos must be chipped or paralyzed first; once Tera Fire is revealed they fail to OHKO and fall to Rock Slide or ally support. Fairy-types like Sylveon and Flutter Mane hate Tera Steel and are cleanly 2HKOed by Drain Punch. Trick Room teams are a mixed bag: Chesnaught underspeeds most setters, so it can drum under TR and sweep, but Hatterene and Indeedee-F can block status and delay the sweep. Opposing weather or terrain can be overwritten by Rillaboon or by running Tornadus with Tailwind to re-establish Glide power. Overall the matchup spread is positive into the current meta cores (Incin + Rilla + Gholdengo) and only becomes shaky versus dedicated BirdSpam or Specs Ice teams, both of which can be patched by correct Tera usage and partner support.</OUTPUT>"

This means the set printed in the dump (Quiet 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD, Life Orb, Trick Room + Expanding Force + Tera Blast Fighting + Protect) can click attacks with impunity while the opponent slowly crumbles under Psychic Terrain-boosted Expanding Forces. The Fighting Tera type is chosen on roughly 73% of teams because it turns Tera Blast into a 100% accurate, 120 BP Fighting move that OHKOes Kingambit, Tyranitar, and most Steel-types that would otherwise wall a pure Psychic attacker. Psychic Tera is kept on the remaining 17% to push Expanding Force\u2019s damage even higher, ensuring KOs on bulkier resists like Rotom-Wash and Skeledirge. Overcoat and Regenerator are almost never used because Magic Guard is the single biggest reason to run Reuniclus over other Trick Room attackers such as Hatterene or Indeedee-F itself. Speed control is mandatory: Reuniclus\u2019s Quiet nature and 0 IVs drop it to 58 Speed, letting it underspeed every positive-nature base 45 (Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, etc.) and every neutral base 50 under Trick Room.

Because Magic Guard blocks Life Orb recoil, Reuniclus can afford to trade repeatedly, and because it ignores status it can stay on the field for multiple turns without needing cleric support.

Against Tailwind offenses the matchup is binary: if Reuniclus sets Trick Room before Tailwind goes up, it wins; if Tailwind is already active, Reuniclus is dead weight. Stall matchups are laughably one-sided: Magic Guard means Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Leech Seed do nothing, and Reuniclus can simply keep clicking attacks until the stall user runs out of PP or switches. The worst matchups are versus other Trick Room teams that carry faster setters like Hatterene (Magic Bounce blocks Taunt) or Indeedee-F that can Imprison Trick Room, and versus Dark-types that can stomach a hit and retaliate\u2014specifically, Choice Band Kingambit survives +1 Tera Blast Fighting and OHKOes back with Iron Head, and bulky Ting-Lu avoids the 2HKO from Expanding Force and phazes with Whirlwind. Opposing Psychic Terrain teams with Indeedee-F also create a mirror situation where the faster team controls terrain and Reuniclus\u2019s Expanding Force drops back to 90 BP, making it far less threatening.</OUTPUT>"

Gholdengo can tank one Helping Hand Expanding Force and retalify with Make It Rain or Shadow Ball, though it must be wary of the 50% roll.

Black Sludge is preferred on teams that already carry a Leftovers user or need the extra passive recovery to out-stall Calm Mind or Bulk Up variants, whereas Leftovers is chosen when status is less of a concern. Knock Off is the cornerstone move, stripping items from Corviknight, Gholdengo, Dondozo and Indeedee to cripple defensive cores. Poison Touch (\u224887 % usage) turns every contact move into a 30 % poison chance, stacking chip on switch-ins and punishing U-turn and Fake Out users. Drain Punch provides Fighting coverage that OHKOes Tera Normal Kingambit and Tera Dark Chien-Pao while restoring health to offset entry hazard chip. Minimize, though seemingly gimmicky, flips games by forcing 33 % accuracy on opposing Dynamax or Tera-boosted attacks, buying free turns for partners such as Smeargle to set webs or for Annihilape to accumulate Final Gambit damage. Protect is mandatory for scouting Choice-locked attackers, gaining extra Black Sludge/Leftovers recovery, and stalling Tailwind and Rain turns. Tera Poison is the most common (\u224823 %) for the Toxic-immunity and the 1.5\u00d7 boost to Gunk Shot (when run) or simply to reinforce its Fairy resist; Tera Grass (\u224834 %) flips the Ground weakness and lets it stomach Earthquakes from Great Tusk and Ting-Lu while ignoring Spore from opposing Smeargle or Amoonguss; Tera Water (\u224816 %) grants a crucial Fire-resist to survive Tera Fire Heatran or Tera Fire Charizard Blast Burn. Power of Alchemy is the default ability to copy fainted allies\u2019 abilities\u2014most notably Intimidate from Pelipper or Flamigo, turning Muk into a double Intimidate pivot that can suddenly neuter physical set-up sweepers. Gluttony is almost never used, and Poison Touch remains the reliable pick when Muk is placed on teams that do not expect to trade allies early.</OUTPUT>"

Tera Steel is almost twice as common as Tera Fairy, granting crucial resistances to Poison, Steel, and opposing priority, and removing Comfey\u2019s Fire weakness; this makes Triage healing even harder to punish and lets Comfey stay on the field longer.

Blizzard under hail is a 140 BP spread move that punishes Grass, Dragon, Ground, and Flying types, meaning Glaceon can single-handedly force double-protects or Tera usage from archetypes like Torkoal-Lilligant or Dragon-spam.  Snow Cloak adds a 20 % miss chance that can flip games\u2014opponents must choose between risking a miss or swapping into a potential Freeze-Dry.

The chosen Tera Water both removes the 4\u00d7 Fire weakness and grants neutrality to Rock and Steel, meaning Glaceon can live a Tera Fire Flutter Mane Heat Wave or a Choice-locked Chien-Kao Sacred Fire and retaliate.  EVs are dumped into HP and SpA to maximise bulk and damage; the speed IV is left at 0 so Glaceon moves last in its speed bracket, letting it fire off a Blizzard under hail before weather can be changed and letting slower partners such as Farigiraf or Toxapex set speed control after it attacks.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Snow Warning is the engine that makes Abomasnow worth considering: automatic hail turns Blizzard into a perfectly accurate, 110 BP spread move and allows Aurora Veil to be deployed without requiring a turn of set-up, giving teammates a valuable damage-reduction cushion. Timid 252/0/0/252/0/252 sets with Choice Scarf or Choice Specs function as fast, immediate wallbreakers, outspeeding key threats such as Chien-Pao and Meowscarada and OHKOing bulky waters like Dondozo with Leaf Storm or Tera-Water boosted Blizzard. Quiet 252/0/0/252/4/0 spreads, usually holding Light Clay, sacrifice Speed to maximize bulk and Veil uptime, acting as a pivot that clicks Aurora Veil first turn and then spams Blizzard or Earth Power for chip. Tera Ghost is the most common option, granting immunities to Fake Out and Fighting-type moves that otherwise spell doom, while Tera Ice boosts STAB Blizzard to nuclear levels and Tera Water patches up the Fire weakness and grants a crucial resistance to opposing hail teams. The prevalence of Kilowattrel and Alolan Ninetales on its teammate list highlights a double-hail core: Kilowattrel removes opposing weather and spreads Tailwind, while Ninetales supplies additional Veil turns and can set up itself, creating a snowballing advantage. Swampert provides Stealth Rock and a reliable Electric immunity, Magmar gives Fake Out and Encore support, and Kommo-o appreciates Veil while supplying a Fighting resist and Clangorous Soul win condition. Despite these synergies, Abomasnow remains highly exploitable: its 90/92/85 bulk is merely adequate, and weaknesses to Fire, Fighting, Rock, Steel and Flying mean common Pok\u00e9mon such as Charizard, Iron Hands, Tyranitar, Gholdengo and Corviknight can switch in with impunity and force it out. Opposing weather\u2014especially Sun\u2014nullifies hail and reduces Blizzard to 70% accuracy, while priority moves like Jet Punch and Gale Wings Brave Bird can pick off a chipped Abomasnow before it moves. Success with Abomasnow therefore hinges on eliminating opposing weather setters, maintaining hazard control, and pairing it with bulky pivots that can absorb super-effective hits and keep Veil active long enough for set-up sweepers to run away with the game.</OUTPUT>"

Cloud Nine remains one of the only ways to completely shut down opposing weather without requiring a turn of setup; this alone forces Primal Kyogre, Torkoal, and Tyranitar to play on even footing, neutering their spread damage and speed-altering synergies. The listed spread reaches 191 HP / 156 Def / 150 SpD after investment\u2014enough to survive a Specs Gholdengo Make It Rain or a +1 Rillaboom Wood Hammer and respond with Tailwind or chip. Brave Bird is chosen over Dragon moves to avoid giving Gholdengo a free switch-in and to pressure Grass-types like Rillaboom and Amoonguss for consistent, non-Intimidate damage. Fire Spin is the set\u2019s most under-appreciated tech: with 85% accuracy it traps Incineroar, Groudon, or opposing support Tera Fairies, racks up 1/8th chip, and breaks Focus Sashes, allowing partners such as Choice Band Sneasler to secure KOs it would otherwise miss. Covert Cloak is preferred on hyper-offense teams that need Altaria to survive multiple Fake Out/Rage Powder cycles, while Sitrus Berry is better on bulkier cores that aim to cycle Intimidate repeatedly. Tera Fairy removes the 4\u00d7 Ice weakness and grants an immunity to Dragon, turning Altaria into an emergency check to opposing Dragon-type restricted Pok\u00e9mon while still retaining STAB on Brave Bird. Tera Steel is a rarer but potent alternative that gives Altria a Flash-Fire-style resistance to both Ice and Rock, letting it pivot into Gholdengo and Glimmora more safely. Natural Cure is almost unseen because Cloud Nine\u2019s passive value outweighs the occasional burn or paralysis removal, especially when paired with Clerics like Primarina or bulky Rillaboom that already carry Aromatherapy or Floral Healing.</OUTPUT>"

What makes the card playable is that the multiplier is passive: every Iron Head is effectively 135 base power before STAB, meaning Perrserker can 2HKO most neutral targets while freeing its item slot for utility instead of a damage-boosting berry or plate. Close Combat covers the mirror Steel matchup and lets it dent Incineroar on predicted Parting Shot turns. Fake Out is mandatory speed control that pairs beautifully with fast partners like Whimsicott or Mienshao, and Protect is Protect. The EV spreads show two philosophies: Impish 252 HP / 252 Def turns Perrserker into a physical wall that survives Choice Band Chien-Pao Ice Spinner and -1 252 Atk Chien-Pao Ice Spinner, while Adamant 252 Atk maximises immediate damage and is usually paired with Tera Steel to pick up the crucial OHKO on bulkless Gholdengo with Iron Head. In practice both sets are viable; the defensive spread is better on slower, bulkier cores with Dondozo, whereas the offensive spread fits hyper-offense shells that already have Intimidate support from Incineroar. Tera Ghost deserves special mention: by removing the Fighting weakness Perrserker can safely switch into predicted Close Combats or Sacred Sword from Koraidon, and the Normal immunity lets it dodge Fake Out, Extreme Speed and Rage Powder, turning the cat into an anti-priority pivot that still enjoys Steely Spirit boosts. Tera Dark is the tech for Psyspam weeks\u2014+1 Iron Head under Steely Spirit cleanly OHKOs Indeedee-F through Psychic Terrain\u2014while Tera Steel is the safe option that keeps your own Iron Head strong and removes the Fire weakness, letting you stomach a Heat Wave from Torkoal or Gholdengo.</OUTPUT>"

Ice Beam is the preferred coverage, cleanly OHKOing Landorus-T and Dragonite after a Modest Life Orb boost, while Weather Ball becomes a 100 BP Water move under rain, giving it a spammable STAB that 2HKOes most neutral targets. Fake Out remains the biggest selling point, allowing Ludicolo to function as a lead that can disrupt set-up sweepers like Dragonite and buy a free turn for its own rain setter. Assault Vest sets sacrifice power for the ability to survive +1 Dragonite Hurricane or Specs Gholdengo Make It Rain, but the majority of successful variants run Life Orb with Mild nature to maximise damage output. Tera Water is the default, turning Weather Ball into a nuclear 130 BP STAB and giving Ludicolo a genuine OHKO ceiling on neutral targets, while Tera Ghost is a tech to block ExtremeSpeed and Fake Out attempts from opposing Dragonite or Indeedee, ensuring it can sweep unimpeded in the late game. Rain teams are the only viable home for Ludicolo; outside of rain its Speed tier is unimpressive and its damage output falls off a cliff, so every team must include either Pelipper or Politoed. The prevalence of Sun and Sand in the current meta means Ludicolo is a matchup pick: devastating versus rain mirrors, bulky Waters and Ground teams, but dead weight versus Torkoal sun or Tyranitar sand.</OUTPUT>"

While its base stats are unremarkable, Serene Grace and Rattled both have situational value, the former occasionally fishing for side-effect hax, the latter punishing Intimidate and Bug-type moves; however, the most common item is Weakness Policy, turning Dudunsparce\u2019s middling bulk into a legitimate offensive threat once it survives a super-effective hit.

In practice this translates into a 525 HP Pok\u00e9mon with 100/90/75 bulk that, after one Calm Mind, sits at effectively +1/+1 and fires off a 100 BP Stored Power that scales to 140 BP after two boosts. The most common spread\u2014Modest 140/0/4/116/4/244\u2014hits 139 Speed, outspeeding neutral-nature base 100s like Dragonite and Gholdengo under Tailwind, while the alternative 156/0/0/252/0/100 spread sacrifices Speed for maximum immediate power. Tera Psychic is mandatory: it turns Stored Power into a STAB 140\u2013200 BP move and grants a crucial resistance to Fighting-type priority, notably allowing Dudunsparce to survive a -1 Mach Punch from Annihilape and KO back. Weakness Policy is the item of choice because Dudunsparce\u2019s bulk guarantees it will survive at least one super-effective hit; Maushold\u2019s Beat Up or Population Bomb can self-proc the Policy in doubles, giving +2 offenses instantly. Serene Grace is the preferred ability for the 30% flinch chance on Air Slash-less Boomburst, but Rattled is a legitimate alternative on teams that expect to face Incineroar or U-turn Lando-T, turning Intimidate cycles into +1 Speed boosts. The moveset is locked: Protect is non-negotiable in doubles, Calm Mind is the win condition, Stored Power is the scaling nuke, and Boomburst is the spread tool that bypasses Ghosts and Wide Guard. Dudunsparce\u2019s EV spreads are optimized to survive key rolls: the 140 HP spread avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tatsugiri\u2019s Draco Meteor and +1 Gholdengo\u2019s Make It Rain, while the 252 SpA spread guarantees the OHKO on 252/0 Gholdengo at +1 with Helping Hand. In practice Dudunsparce functions as a mid-game wincon that requires two free turns\u2014one to set up, one to attack\u2014but once it reaches +2/+2 it becomes almost impossible to revenge-kill without a faster Dark-type or a double-target.</OUTPUT>"

It heavily pressures Amoonguss + Torkoal sun, as neither wants to eat a +1 Boomburst and Stored Power ignores Rage Powder.

Tailwind from the likes of Pelipper or Tornadus-T can race it, but if Dudunsparce is already set up it will still move first under its own Tailwind. Trick Room is a mixed bag: while Dudunsparce underspeeds most Trick Room attackers, it fears being burned by Indeedee-F\u2019s Follow Me + Dusk-Mane Necrozma\u2019s Sunsteel Strike. Shadow Tag from Gothitelle can trap and wear it down, but Gothitelle must be wary of +2 Stored Power.

Its role is to enter after a KO or on a predicted Protect, click Calm Mind while its partner redirects or sets Tailwind, and then snowball through the opposing team with Stored Power. Because Stored Power\u2019s BP scales with the number of stat boosts, Dudunsparce becomes exponentially more dangerous the longer the game drags on; after two Calm Minds it reaches 200 BP, at which point even resisted targets crumble. The Weakness Policy variant functions as both a wincon and a deterrent, forcing opponents to choose between leaving Dudunsparce untouched and risking a sweep or targeting it and triggering +2 offenses. In speed tiers it acts as a pseudo-fast attacker under Tailwind, sitting at 278 Speed (139\u00d72) and outspeeding +1 base 100s, but it can also function under Trick Room thanks to its naturally low Speed. Its typing gives it only one weakness\u2014Fighting\u2014but also only one relevant resistance\u2014Psychic\u2014meaning its bulk is honest rather than typing-dependent. The Normal typing is a double-edged sword: it grants STAB Boomburst, the strongest spread move in the game, but also means Dudunsparce is vulnerable to Ghost immunities unless it Terastallizes. In team structures it is almost always paired with Maushold for self-Policy activation, and with Tailwind or redirection support to guarantee setup.

After halving its own HP it triggers either Salac Berry (for speed) or Custap Berry (for priority) via Gluttony, letting it outspeed or out-priority most of the metagame at +6 Attack. Facade is the preferred STAB: with a status condition (most commonly self-induced via Flame Orb or an ally\u2019s status move) it reaches a blistering 140 base power, cleanly OHKOing neutral targets even through Dynamax bulk. Body Slam is kept for situations where burn or poison is undesirable, offering a useful 30 % paralysis chance that can further aid a sweep. Protect is mandatory for enabling a safe Drum turn or for stalling out opposing Dynamax turns. Thick Fat is the most common ability because it removes two otherwise troublesome weaknesses; Gluttony, however, is the lynchpin of the Berry sets and is run almost as frequently. Sassy nature with heavy Special Defense investment lets Snorlax stomach strong special attackers\u2014most notably Miraidon, Iron Valiant, and Tornadus\u2014and still have enough HP left after Belly Drum to activate its Berry. Tera Ghost is dominant because it provides a Fighting immunity, blocks Fake Out, and makes it immune to Extreme Speed from opposing Dragonite or Lucario, while Tera Ground grants an Electric immunity and removes the Toxic vulnerability that can otherwise stall out Custap variants. EV spreads aim to guarantee survival against common spread attackers like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle while still maximizing Attack after Drum.</OUTPUT>"

Rock Slide provides secondary spread damage with a coveted flinch chance, while High Horsepower offers a single-target Ground option that avoids Earthquake\u2019s partner damage, letting Rhyperior function outside of Telepathy or Protect support. Protect is mandatory on every set because Rhyperior is slow enough to move last in most speed tiers, meaning it can safely scout choice-locked opponents or wait out Dynamon turns while partners redirect or set Trick Room. Solid Rock is the most common ability (\u224859 % usage) because it effectively gives Rhyperior 4/3 bulk against super-effective hits, letting it survive rain-boosted Surging Strikes, Moonblast + Mystical Fire from Flutter Mane, or even max SpA Life Orb Gholdengo Make It Rain. Lightning Rod is situationally useful on teams that stack Discharge or Thunder Wave users such as Togekiss or Zapdos, turning Rhyperior into a lightning rod that simultaneously boosts its otherwise mediocre SpA, though the boost is rarely relevant outside of mirror matches. Reckless is almost unseen but technically legal, powering up High Horsepower and the seldom-used Rock Wrecker if one opts for a meme set. Terastallization gives Rhyperior a second life: Tera Ground boosts STAB Earthquake to nuclear levels while removing the 4\u00d7 Grass and Water weaknesses, Tera Grass flips the script on Water- and Grass-type attackers by turning them into resisted hits, and Tera Poison grants a crucial Toxic immunity and useful resistances to Fairy and Fighting while retaining the Rock typing\u2019s Flying and Bug resistances.

The chosen spread (Adamant 68/252/4/0/36/148) hits 140 Speed at level 50, enough to outrun uninvested base 90s and most support Pok\u00e9mon under tailwind, while 68 HP plus 36 SpD guarantees it survives modest Ice Beam or Dazzling Gleam rolls. Shell Armor eliminates the threat of random critical hits, making it a dependable Dynamax candidate that can set its own Gravity or grassy terrain via Max Quake and Max Overgrowth. Its teammates\u2014Tatsugiri, Dondozo, Tinkaton, Glimmora, Kilowattrel, and Tyranitar\u2014point toward a balanced offense that manipulates speed control via Dondozo\u2013Tatsugiri synergy, hazard pressure from Glimmora, and flying-type speed control from Kilowattrel. Torterra\u2019s main job is to soften bulky Waters and Gastrodon for Dondozo, break Tinkaton and Gholdengo for Tyranitar, and provide a secondary Max Quake user that raises SpD for the whole squad. It demands heavy team support to cover Ice-, Flying-, and Bug-type weaknesses, but it can single-handedly flip matchups against Rain, Sand, and Gastrodon-centric balances.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Torterra\u2019s base stats are deceptively middling\u201495/109/105/75/85/56\u2014yet its typing grants it valuable resistances to Rock and Electric and an immunity to Electric once grounded. The dominant ability choice, Shell Armor (seen on ~75 % of sampled builds), patches its otherwise crippling vulnerability to critical hits, a crucial boon when it is expected to trade with Life Orb recoil and sand or hail chip. Overgrow variants exist but are strictly worse: the power bonus is unreliable and Shell Armor\u2019s consistency is why Torterra even sees experimentation. Life Orb is the only item worth considering; without it Torterra fails to secure key KOs such as 252 HP Gastrodon after Stealth Rock or 252 HP Torkoal through sun-boosted Max Overgrowth. The EV spread maximizes Attack, drops Defense to 4, and invests 148 EVs in Speed to reach 140 at L50, outpacing max-Speed neutral-nature base 70s (Bisharp, Lilligant) and creeping bulky Rotom-W and Indeedee. 68 HP plus 36 SpD lets it survive modest Ice Beam from Pelipper or Sylveon after Life Orb recoil. The four-move set is non-negotiable: Protect buys positioning turns next to Dondozo or Tatsugiri, Headlong Rush is a 120 BP Ground move that drops Defense but nukes Toxapex, Gholdengo, and opposing Tyranitar, Wood Hammer is a 120 BP Grass move that OHKOes Gastrodon and Rotom-W while 2HKOing Slowking-G, and Earthquake is a spread option that avoids Defense drops and synergizes with ally Tatsugiri\u2019s Ally Switch or Dondozo\u2019s wide Guard. Ground Tera is taken on ~72 % of teams, turning Headlong Rush into a 140 BP STAB and removing the Ice weakness for a turn while preserving Grass STAB for Max Overgrowth. Tera Ground also lets Tortera survive a Timid Specs Tatsugiri Draco Meteor or modest Iron Bundle Freeze-Dry and retaliate. The biggest drawback is the 4\u00d7 Ice weakness: Kyurem, Iron Bundle, and Abomasnow shred it, while Flying-types like Corviknight, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus can pivot on it freely. Torterra also dislikes Intimidate cycles and burns, since it relies on immediate power rather than setup. Nevertheless, it occupies a unique speed tier between true Trick Room abusers and fast attackers, letting it function in both modes depending on partner speed control. Dondozo\u2019s Order Up boosts can raise its Attack, while Tinkaton\u2019s Gigaton Hammer removes opposing Flying-types. Glimmora sets Toxic Spikes to wear down bulky Waters that wall Torterra, and Kilowattrel provides Tailwind or Rain to let Torterra outpace scarf threats. Tyranitar sets sand to break Focus Sashes and adds Rock-type chip to Flying- and Ice-types. Overall, Torterra is a high-maintenance but rewarding pick that compresses roles of breaker, secondary Dynamax, and terrain setter into one slot.</OUTPUT>"

Against Sun, it baits Torkoal and survives modest Overheat, then OHKOes back with Max Quake; Torkoal needs Helping Hand or Sun-boosted Eruption to secure the KO. Versus Sand, Torterra pressures Tyranitar and Gastrodon, but must watch for Iron Head flinches and Dracovish\u2019s Fishious Rend; it can Tera Ground to survive Specs Draco from Hydreigon and retaliate.

It hates Iron Bundle and Kyurem, which outspeed even in Tailwind and OHKO with Freeze-Dry; accordingly, it requires Tera or ally Kilowattrel to remove them. Corviknight walls it unless Torterra carries Flamethrower (it doesn\u2019t), so Tinkaton or Tyranitar must deal with it. Amoonguss blanks both STABs and must be poisoned by Glimmora or cleared by Kilowattrel\u2019s Hurricane.

Under Dynamax, it sets Gravity with Max Quake (raising SpD for the team) or Grassy Terrain with Max Overgrowth (healing allies and weakening opposing Earthquake). After Tera Ground, it becomes a short-lived tank that can trade with Specs users and survive super-effective hits. Because it carries Protect, it can stall Dynamax turns or wait for speed control to be established.

Once boosted, STAB Sucker Punch (priority) and Knock Off (removal + high BP) give it immediate, board-wide pressure, while Leaf Blade covers Rock- and Water-types that shrug off Dark damage. Tera Dark is taken on three quarters of sets because it amplifies both STABs and turns Sucker Punch into a nuclear 80 \u2192 120 BP option, letting Shiftry pick off faster threats such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and weakened Terapagos before they move. Focus Sash is the only common item: it guarantees Shiftry survives at least one hit so it can either retaliate or get a Protect read for partner positioning. Adamant 252/252 spreads maximise damage and ensure a 75% chance to OHKO 0 HP Flutter Mane through Tera Dark, while the remaining 4 EVs are dropped into Sp. Def to slightly improve its poor special bulk. Chlorophyll is occasionally run on sun teams, but the data show Wind Rider is overwhelmingly preferred because Tailwind is ubiquitous and self-triggering the boost is more reliable than depending on nine-turn sun. Pickpocket remains a non-factor. Overall Shiftry is a matchup fish: into teams that rely on Tailwind or lack Fake Out / priority of their own, it can feel oppressive; into more traditional Incineroar / Rillaboard cores it struggles to get on the field at all.</OUTPUT>"

The EV spread listed above guarantees that Ursaluna-Bloodmoon lives a +1 Max Airstream from Dragonite and a Specs Tera Water Spout from Kyogre in Rain, while still 2HKOing most of the tier with Blood Moon. Leftovers variants sacrifice immediate power for longevity and are usually paired with Aurora Veil or Reflect/Light Screen to create setup windows for partners like Dragonite or Rillaboom. Hyper Voice is deceptally strong after STAB and spread modifiers, doing ~35% to both foes on the field and breaking Focus Sashes on frail leads such as Talonflame or Indeedee. Earth Power is the only coverage needed because Blood Moon already hits every Grass, Water, and Psychic-type for neutral or better damage; the slot is flexible and some teams drop it for Calm Mind, Substitute, or even Tera Blast Ice to lure Landorus-T and Dragonite. Tera Normal is the default because it maximises Blood Moon and grants a Ghost immunity, flipping matchups versus Aegislash and Dragapult. Tera Electric is the next most popular, removing the Flying weakness and giving a BoltBeam-esque coverage alongside Hyper Voice, while also letting Ursaluna-Bloodmoon overload common Water-type pivots such as Pelipper and Toxapex.

The Assault Vest set acts as a pivot that can switch into Flutter Mane\u2019s Shadow Ball or Gholdengo\u2019s Make It Rain, retaliate with Earth Power or Blood Moon, and maintain offensive momentum. Life Orb variants are more explosive and prefer to lead early alongside Fake Out or Follow Me to guarantee a first-turn kill, then return later once checks are weakened. Because Blood Moon ignores Protect, the bear is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that can punish double-Protect stalling and force 2v2 trades in your favor. Its Ghost immunity after Tera Normal also lets it serve as an emergency spinblocker versus Rapid Spin Gholdengo or Iron Treads, preserving hazards for teammates like Gholdengo or Dragonite. In Tailwind mirrors, Ursaluna-Bloodmoon becomes a 90-base Speed monster that outspeeds and OHKOes Timid Flutter Mane, turning the mirror on its head. In Trick Room, its natural 52 Speed becomes an asset, outslowing even minimum Speed Torkoal and Dondozo under reversed speeds.

Bulk Up patches its merely decent base 110 Attack and pushes its already respectable bulk\u2014110/80/90\u2014to stalling thresholds, especially when combined with Drain Punch recovery. Rage Fist starts at 50 BP but climbs by 50 for every hit the ape endures, turning it into a 350 BP nuke after just six pings. Protect is omnipresent because it both scouts choice locks and accelerates Rage Fist stacking. Tera usage is split between Water (to remove a nasty Fairy weakness and neuter common Water-type moves) and Fire (to exploit Sun teams and remove a Grass weakness), with Water slightly edging out Fire in popularity. Itemization is surprisingly sparse\u2014Leftovers, Safety Goggles, and Sitrus Berry each appear at under 0.4% usage\u2014indicating that most players treat Annihilape as a disposable win-condition rather than a long-term tank.

Aurora Veil effectively grants the entire team Reflect and Light Screen for five turns (eight with Light Clay, though the item slot is usually contested). This single move compresses team-building by freeing teammates from needing bulky EV investments or additional screens. Blizzard is chosen over Ice Beam for the spread damage and 100 % accuracy in hail, punishing both foes simultaneously. Icy Wind provides speed control that stacks with Tailwind or replaces it when the opponent denies tailwind, while also breaking Focus Sash and chipping into common 4\u00d7 Ice-weak threats such as Dragapult, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Protect is mandatory doubles tech, allowing Ninetales to stall opposing Dynamax turns, dodge double-targets, and maintain field position. EV spreads are almost exclusively Timid with maximum Speed and Special Attack; the remaining 4 EVs are placed in either HP or Defense to slightly optimize bulk versus physical or special attackers.

Kowtow Cleave is the centerpiece\u2014an 85 BP Dark move that bypasses accuracy checks and Protect, giving Kingambit a spammable STAB that can muscle through common Protect stalling. Sucker Punch supplies essential priority that patches up its Speed tier, picking off faster threats like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, or weakened Gholdengo. Iron Head covers Fairy-types such as Sylveon or the ever-present Xerneas support, while also giving a solid neutral option into Ice-weak Dragon restricteds. Protect is almost mandatory in doubles to shield Kingambit from double-targets and to buy positioning turns for its teammates. The item split between Assault Vest and Black Glasses illustrates two philosophies: Vest variants sacrifice Protect for a surprise special tank set that can switch into Kyogre\u2019s Water Spout or Indeedee-F\u2019s Psychic, whereas Glasses variants stay with Protect and maximize immediate damage output. Terastallizing into Flying is the consensus best defensive option, flipping the script on opposing Great Tusk, Iron Hands, or opposing Kingambit mirror match-ups by removing the Fighting weakness and adding a Ground immunity; Tera Dark is reserved for offensive bursts when you simply need the extra 1.5\u00d7 damage to secure KOs on bulky restricteds like Zacian-C or Dialga. In terms of EV spreads, most players default to 252 HP / 252 Atk or 252 HP / 156 Atk / 100 SpD to survive key hits such as +1 Moonblast from Xerneas or a Specs Tornadus-T Hurricane, but the data set does not provide exact numbers\u2014teams should tailor bulk to survive what their cores otherwise cannot.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Pelipper\u2019s niche begins and ends with Drizzle: no other weather setter combines perfect accuracy, immediate activation and usable offensive stats. Base 85 Special Attack is modest, but under rain STAB Muddy Water reaches 126 base power and Hurricane becomes perfectly accurate, giving Pelipper deceptively high damage output against Incineroar, Torkoal, Gholdengo, Dragonite and indeed most of the format\u2019s bulky pivots. The chosen EV spread maximises Speed to outrun Adamant Chien-Pao and Timid Gholdengo before Tailwind, ensuring rain is up before Kingambit or Torkoal can attempt to overwrite it. Focus Sash is the most common item, guaranteeing that Pelipper survives the first turn so it can reset weather later in the game; Choice Scarf is the aggressive alternative, letting it act as a surprise revenge killer and faster Tailwind setter that can flip the speed tier against opposing scarf users such as Garchomp or Gholdengo. Tera Ghost is taken on nearly 60% of teams because it removes the 4\u00d7 Electric weakness, blocks Fake Out and grants a crucial immunity to opposing Gholdengo\u2019s Make It Rain, while still allowing Pelipper to retain its Flying STAB. The four-moveset is almost invariant: Tailwind for speed control, Hurricane for damage and spread flinch potential, Muddy Water for spread STAB and Weather Ball for a 100 BP Water move that becomes Ice in hail or Fire in sun, giving Pelipper a mid-game surprise factor once Tera has been revealed. Pelipper\u2019s greatest strength is how little support it needs: one ally with Swift Swim or Electric coverage is usually enough to turn rain into a win condition, and because it is naturally bulky on the special side (base 100 HP / 90 SpD) it can afford to invest everything in Speed and still live most neutral special hits. Its main drawbacks are four-moveslot syndrome\u2014wanting Protect, Roost, Wide Guard or Ice Beam\u2014and the fact that resetting weather is a commitment: once Pelipper is KOed, rain teams often collapse to sun or sand in the end-game. Nevertheless, the duck remains the single most important weather setter in the format, and any team that hopes to succeed in a Bo3 environment needs a specific answer to it.</OUTPUT>"

Against opposing weatherless teams Pelipper behaves like a fast utility pivot, outspeeding and 2HKOing most Incineroar variants with Hurricane while threatening Gholdengo and Dragonite with rain-boosted Muddy Water. Electric-types are the obvious counters, but because Pelipper usually Tera Ghosts on turn 1 the traditional Rotom-W or Iron Hands must instead rely on neutral STAB or coverage moves, giving Pelipper one free turn to set Tailwind or attack. Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss are problematic if rain is already up, since they resist both STABs and can retalitate with Glide or Spore; however, Pelipper can Terastallise and click Hurricane for heavy damage, or simply switch to a teammate like Gholdengo or Incineroar that enjoys Grass targets. Kingambit is a mixed bag: it fears rain-boosted Muddy Water but can Sucker Punch Pelipper into sash range and then finish with Iron Head if rain has been overwritten. In the mirror, speed control becomes paramount: the faster Pelipper wins the weather war, so Choice Scarf variants have a massive edge, and both players often burn Tera Ghost early to block Fake Out from the opposing Incineroar.

Tatsugiri\u2019s own spread is EVed to survive incidental spread damage (Modest 156/0/132/4/4/212) or maximize Speed to fire off fast Icy Winds and Draco Meteors (Timid 252 Spe). Draco Meteor gives it a 130 BP STAB nuke that still does respectable chip to neutral targets even with no investment, while Muddy Water provides spread damage and a handy 30 % accuracy debuff for end-game fishing. Icy Wind is the preferred speed-control option because it works from the safety of Commander, letting Dondozo outspeed key threats without requiring Tera or further support. Protect is mandatory when you are eventually forced onto the field, because almost any unresisted STAB attack will KO. Tera Fairy is the default to dodge Dragon-type retaliation aimed at Dondozo and to gain a crucial resistance to Dark and Fighting moves; Tera Steel is an alternative that flips the Fairy and Ice weaknesses into resistances, making it easier to stomach a Moonblast or an Ice Spinner. Choice Scarf is occasionally run to outspeed opposing Scarfers when Tatsugiri is forced to fight alone, but Safety Goggles is the preferred item to ignore enemy Amoonguss and Glimmora hazards while you set up the combo.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Prankster is the engine that makes Whimsicott irreplaceable: every non-damaging move gains +1 priority, so Tailwind, Encore, and Fake Tears all outpace even opposing priority. This allows Whimsicott to punish setup sweepers, lock support Pok\u00e9mon into Protect or useless status moves, and instantly tilt the speed tiers for its slower but powerful partners. The chosen Timid 252 HP / 252 Speed spread maximises both bulk and speed; at 116 base Speed it naturally outruns the crowded 100-110 tier, while the remaining EVs are dumped into HP to survive stray spread moves or a single neutral hit. Covert Cloak is the item of choice because it ignores the secondary effects of Fake Out, Rock Slide flinches, and Nuzzle paralysis, ensuring Whimsicott executes its game plan even under pressure. Focus Sash is a lower-usage but still valid option on more offensive teams that need to guarantee Tailwind versus double-target focus fire. Tera Steel is preferred for the key resistances to Rock, Poison, and Ice\u2014common spread-move types\u2014plus a crucial Toxic immunity, while Tera Ghost blocks Extreme Speed and gives a one-turn dodge to Fake Out and Rapid Spin. Encore is the most punishing tool: after an opponent uses Protect or a setup move, locking them into it for even one turn usually nets a free switch or double-up opportunity. Fake Tears is a 2-for-1 special defense drop that turns standard calcs into OHKOs for the likes of Basculegion\u2019s Hydro Pump or Gholdengo\u2019s Make It Rain. Moonblast rounds the set by giving Whimsicott a spammable STAB that 2HKOs most Dragons and Dark-types while occasionally dropping their special attack. The listed teammates\u2014Incineroar, Basculegion, Pelipper, Archaludon, Gholdengo, Ursaluna-Bloodmoon\u2014illustrate two archetypes: rain/bulky pivot builds that abuse perfect accuracy Thunders and Hurricanes, and hard-hitting Trick Room counter builds that want Tailwind to reverse opposing room or to operate outside room themselves. Whimsicott\u2019s presence forces opponents to respect both speed brackets, compressing their options and often causing over-protecting or mis-clicking into Encore.</OUTPUT>"

This single ability underpins its entire competitive identity and explains its 45 % usage share. The terrain lasts eight turns, giving the rest of the team a long window to operate without fear of priority or sleep. Offensively, Indeedee is modest: base 95 Special Attack is merely adequate, but STAB Expanding Force under terrain reaches 120 base power and spread damage, turning Indeedee into a legitimate offensive presence against neutral targets. Timid nature is preferred on roughly two-thirds of spreads to outspeed modest base 80s and below, ensuring it can fire off a terrain-boosted Expanding Force or get Trick Room up before taking damage. Focus Sash is the item of choice on 62 % of teams, guaranteeing at least one full turn of terrain or Trick Room even against double-targeting or Zacian-style aggression; Choice Scarf appears on 30 % of builds, turning Indeedee into a fast terrain setter that can still underspeed most Scarfers after Trick Room is up. Tera Psychic is overwhelmingly the preferred Tera type, pushing Expanding Force to nuclear levels while keeping the terrain benefit. The remaining EV spreads are minimalist: 4/0/0/252/0/252 or 0/0/0/252/4/252 maximize Speed and Special Attack with minimal bulk investment, underscoring Indeedee\u2019s role as a one-turn pivot rather than a long-term tank.</OUTPUT>"

Into Incineroar, Kingambit, or Breloom squads that lean on Fake Out + Sucker Punch cores, Psychic Terrain turns their game plan off and forces them to play honest, slower tempo. Against faster offensive squads built around Dragapult, Iron Valiant, or Choice-scarf Koraidon, Indeedee can trade turns: it either sets Trick Room to let its own slower threats move first, or fires a spread Expanding Force to chunk the opposition before going down. Terrain also neuters Amoonguss, the most common support Pok\u00e9mon in the format, by blocking Spore and Rage Powder, allowing partners such as Gholdengo or Annihilape to click attacks or set up without disruption. On the flip side, Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Kingambit shrug off Expanding Force, while Dark-types like Tyranitar and Chien-Pao are immune and can retaliate with heavy damage. Shadow Rider Calyrex outspeeds and OHKOes with Astral Barrage, and any faster Taunt user (e.g., Whimsicott, Grimmsnarl) can shut down Trick Room attempts. Terrain only affects grounded Pok\u00e9mon, so flying or levitating attackers such as Tornadus, Lando-T, or Flutter Mane still enjoy their priority options. Finally, because Indeedee is almost always Sashed or Scarfed, multi-hit attackers like Breloom\u2019s Bullet Seed or Kingambit\u2019s Supreme Overlord-boosted attacks can break the Sash and KO, while residual damage from Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs can cripple it before it accomplishes its mission.</OUTPUT>"

Taunt users\u2014Whimsicott, Grimmsnarl, or Iron Valiant\u2014shut down Trick Room and force Indeedee to attack into potential immunities. Multi-hit moves like Breloom\u2019s Bullet Seed or Kingambit\u2019s Supreme Overlord-boosted attacks break Sash and KO, while Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs chip can deny the second turn. Terrain only affects grounded Pok\u00e9mon, so Levitate Bronzong or Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon such as Corviknight or Togekiss still fire priority moves. Finally, because Indeedee is almost always the first Pok\u00e9mon to faint, opposing teams can simply ignore it, KO the partner, and deal with terrain later; if Indeedee fails to set Trick Room or land meaningful damage, it becomes a 3-v-4 uphill battle.</OUTPUT>"

Stomping Tantrum is chosen over Rock Slide or Iron Head because it keeps the spread option under Earthquake, retains perfect accuracy, and doubles base power after a missed Protect, giving Garchomp a deceptively strong single-target move that still synergises with its Ground Tera. Protect is mandatory on non-Scarf sets to enable safe positioning next to Earthquake partners or to stall Dynamax turns. Tera Steel is the dominant choice because it removes the 4\u00d7 Ice weakness, grants a crucial Dragon immunity, and turns Fairy and Rock neutral, letting Garchomp survive common coverage moves such as Dazzling Gleam, Moonblast, Glacial Lance or Ice Spinner while still hitting back with unboosted STAB. Tera Ground is situationally used to boost Earthquake into an absurdly powerful spread move under Grassy Terrain or when facing Electric or Poison teams.

Against Trick Room, Tyranitar is one of the few offensive Pok\u00e9mon that can sit on the field and stall turns thanks to its augmented special bulk; Rock Slide flinches and sand chip wear down Hatterene and Porygon2. Versus hyper-offense, Tera Flying removes its Ground weakness and lets it survive Earthquakes from Garchomp and Great Tusk while retaliating with super-effective Tera Blast. Stall teams struggle to wear it down because sand plus Knock Off removes Leftovers and Black Sludge, and Assault Vest prevents them from breaking it with special attackers like Slowking-G or Toxapex. The only archetypes that truly trouble Tyranitar are dedicated Terrain-based teams: Indeedee-F\u2019s Psychic Terrain blocks Fake Out support and allows Expanding Force spam, while Grassy Terrain recovery offsets sand chip and empowers opposing Rillaboom.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Torkoal\u2019s niche in the current regulation is defined by two factors: automatic Sun and a 140 BP spread move that benefits from that Sun. Drought is used on 99.7 % of sampled teams, so its primary job is to summon harsh sunlight the moment it hits the field. This single mechanic flips the offensive math for its teammates\u2014boosting Fire-type moves by 50 % and weakening Water-type moves to the point that many resisted Water attacks fail to KO. Eruption is the star of the set: at \u20131 speed (Quiet) and full HP it is effectively a 210 BP Fire spread move, out-damaging even Specs Heat Wave from faster threats. Heat Wave is the reliable secondary STAB for when Torkoal has taken chip, while Earth Power covers Torkoal\u2019s most feared switch-in: opposing Fire-types and Tera Fire steels. Protect is nearly mandatory to preserve Eruption power and to give partners a free turn to set up Trick Room or Tailwind. The two main spreads are functionally identical: Quiet 252/0/0/252/4/0 and Quiet 252/0/4/252/0/0 both maximize special output and bulk, with the spare 4 EVs either padding special defense or physical defense to hit specific damage rolls. Charcoal is the safe pick that keeps item flexibility, Choice Specs turns Torkoal into a literal nuke that 2HKOs most neutral targets even without Sun, and Eject Pack is the tech for teams that want Torkoal to fire once and immediately tag in a faster cleaner. Tera Fire is the overwhelmingly preferred option because it boosts both STABs and removes the Rock weakness, letting Torkoal survive common spread moves like Rock Slide and Grassy Glide. The data show virtually zero variance in move slots, indicating that the community has settled on the four-move set that maximizes spread damage and coverage.</OUTPUT>"

Trick Room teams are a skill matchup: if Torkoal is paired with Indeedee-F to set Psychic Terrain, it can nullate priority Rage Powder and fire off uncontested Eruptions; if the opponent sets Trick Room first, Torkoal becomes the fastest threat under Trick Room and flips the script.

Justified\u2019s 0.25% usage is a relic from older formats where Dark-type targets were more common; Steadfast\u2019s 1% is pure cheese that rarely activates in doubles. Item-wise Gallade is surprisingly flexible: Clear Amulet (27%) blocks Intimidate and Parting Shot, preserving its damage output versus Incineroar and opposing Attack drops; Sitrus (41%) is the most consistent, giving it a 25% heal after the 50% threshold, which combined with its EV bulk lets it survive two neutral 90 BP moves or one super-effective 120 BP move; Focus Sash (25%) guarantees a Trick Room versus faster leads like Chien-Pao or Iron Bundle, but is more exploitable with spread and multi-hit moves. The two dominant spreads both run Adamant nature: the bulky 252 HP / 116 Atk / 132 Def / 4 SpD / 4 Spe outspeeds uninvested base 80s while living key rolls such as Life Orb Gholdengo Shadow Ball and +1 Dragonite Extreme Speed; the fast 252 Atk / 252 Spe set is used when Gallade is expected to operate outside Trick Room, notably on teams with Zoroark-Hisui or Annihilape that want the option to flip between speed modes. Move slots are almost fixed: Trick Room is mandatory for the archetype, Psychic and Sacred Sword are the Sharpness-boosted STABs that hit everything bar Fairies and ghosts for neutral or better, and Protect is Protect. Tera Water is the most popular because it removes the 4\u00d7 Fire and 2\u00d7 Flying weaknesses, letting Gallade stomach Heat Wave from Tornadus or Charizard and retaliate; Tera Grass flips the Gastrodon and Rotom-Wash matchups and halves Water damage from Pelipper rain teams; Tera Stellar is a tech for end-game cleaning, giving a one-time 1.2\u00d7 damage boost to both STABs and removing weaknesses for a turn. Gallade\u2019s synergy partners\u2014Indeedee-F, Annihilape, Zoroark-Hisui, Archaludon, Rillaboom and Volcarona\u2014showcase its role as the primary setter on semi-room: Indeedee-F sets Psychic Terrain to block priority and lets Gallade click Trick Room safely; Annihilape appreciates Psychic Terrain and Trick Room to spam Rage Fist; Zoroark-Hisui disguised as Gallade can bluff the set while Gallade itself can underspeed to operate under opposing Trick Room; Archaludon and Volcarona are powerful slow attackers that thrive under room, while Rillaboom gives Grassy Terrain recovery and priority Fake Out to ease setup.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Gallade is a hybrid offensive Trick Room setter that compresses speed control and immediate wall-breaking into one slot. Unlike passive setters such as Bronzong or Oranguru, Gallade threatens to OHKO or 2HKO most opposing setters and Follow-Me users, deterring them from staying in and allowing its own team to claim the room. Once Trick Room is active, Gallade becomes a 112 BP Psycho Cut / 117 BP Sacred Sword attacker that forces switches and chips bulky neutrals into range of slower teammates like Annihilape or Volcarona. Its EV spreads are tuned to survive the most common spread and single-target hits while retaining enough attack to secure KOs\u2014after Stealth-of-stone damage or chip, Gallade\u2019s Sacred Sword always KOs 252 HP Incineroar and 2HKOs 252 HP Gholdengo. The presence of Clear Amulet or Sitrus Berry lets it function as a soft check to Intimidate and Fake Out cores, while Tera Water turns it into a temporary tank versus Fire- and Flying-type moves that normally force it out. In short, Gallade is the \u201coffensive setter\u201d that trades the longevity of Dusclops or the support movepool of Indeedee-F for the ability to delete problematic Psychic-weak or Defense-dropping threats before they can act.</OUTPUT>"

Overcoat is the clear ability of choice, appearing on 154.6 out of every 165 Kommo-o, because it single-handedly removes the single biggest obstacle to Dragon-type progress: Amoonguss. With Rage Powder and Spore nullified, Kommo-o can freely target the slot it needs to, and because Clanging Scales is a spread move, it still damages both foes even when a partner cycles into Protect. The chosen EV spread maximizes physical bulk while retaining enough special bulk to survive Life Orb Flutter Mane Shadow Ball + Moonblast, and because Kommo-o\u2019s base 110 Special Attack is naturally high, it can afford to run Bold nature and still hit key benchmarks: +1 252+ SpA Clanging Scales always OHKOs standard Gholdengo and 2HKOs 252 HP Dondozo, while uninvested Flamethrower cleanly OHKOs 252 HP Corviknight through Tera Fire. Aura Sphere rounds out coverage by nailing Kingambit and Tyranitar for OHKOs after a Throat Spray boost, and because both STABs trigger the item, Kommo-o can boost simply by attacking. Tera Fire is non-negotiable: it removes the Fairy weakness, turns Moonblast into a neutral 80 BP hit, and grants a crucial Ice resistance that lets Kommo-o survive Chien-Pao\u2019s Ice Spinner and Glaive Rush. The 8% of sets that opt for Bulletproof or Soundproof are largely gimmicks\u2014Bulletproof does block Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb, but Overcoat\u2019s utility against Amoonguss and opposing weather chip is simply too valuable. Item-wise, Throat Spray\u2019s 0.37% usage belies its importance: once Kommo-o clicks either STAB, it immediately becomes a +1 Special Attacker, turning 2HKOs into OHKOs without the predictability of a setup turn. Life Orb appears on only 0.17% of teams, suggesting players prefer the free boost and longevity that Throat Spray and Leftovers provide. In practice, Kommo-o functions as a mid-game pivot that can trade positively against most of the tier\u2019s top threats\u2014Gholdengo, Kingambit, Corviknight, and opposing Dragons\u2014while blanking Amoonguss entirely. Its ability to compress the roles of speed control deterrent, spread attacker, and Tera user into a single slot makes it one of the most slot-efficient Pok\u00e9mon in the format.</OUTPUT>"

Against Steel, it dominates: Flamethrower OHKOs Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Kingambit, while Aura Sphere handles Tera Fairy Kingambit. Against Grass, Overcoat blank Amoonguss and lets Kommo-o ignore Rage Powder, turning the matchup into a free double-target scenario. Against Ice, Tera Fire is again crucial, letting it live Chien-Pao\u2019s Ice Spinner and retaliate with Aura Sphere for the OHKO. Against Psychic, it checks Indeedee\u2013Armarouge cores by ignoring Follow Me and OHKOing Armarouge with Clanging Scales while tanking Indeedee\u2019s Helping Hand Psychic. Against Fire, it struggles pre-Tera but can still survive Torkoal Eruption in sun and 2HKO back with Clanging Scales; post-Tera Fire, it becomes neutral to Fire moves and can trade evenly. Against Ghost, it beats Gholdengo and Aegislash but must watch for Tera Fairy Annihilape. Against Dragon, it out-bulks all non-Tera Fairy variants and wins the mirror by surviving opposing Clanging Scales and retaliating for the KO. Against Ground, it survives Life Orb Great Tusk Headlong Rush and OHKOs back with Aura Sphere. In short, Kommo-o\u2019s matchups are overwhelmingly positive against Steel, Grass, Psychic, and Dragon cores, neutral against Fire and Ice after Tera, and only truly poor against Tera Fairy variants that it cannot outpace without speed control.</OUTPUT>"

It is not a dedicated win-condition, nor is it a pure support Pok\u00e9mon; instead, it occupies the flexible \u201cthird slot\u201d on teams that already have a dedicated lead duo and a restricted legendary. Because Overcoat blanks spore and chip, Kommo-o can switch into Amoonguss freely, forcing the opponent to either double-target it\u2014risking a Protect\u2014or allow it to fire off a free Clanging Scales. Once Throat Spray is triggered, its Special Attack jumps to effectively 604, letting it OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier without further setup. The Tera Fire transformation is usually timed mid-game, either to flip a Fairy matchup or to survive an otherwise lethal Ice-type move, after which Kommo-o becomes a 118/125/125 bulk monster that still hits 332 Special Attack. Its speed tier of 259 (after Icy Wind) outspeeds positive-nature base 135s such as Chien-Pao, meaning that with a single speed-control drop it can operate as a pseudo-scarfer. In the late game, Kommo-o can clean weakened teams by alternating between Clanging Scales and coverage, and because both STABs trigger Throat Spray, it can boost on the same turn it attacks, making it extremely low-maintenance. The presence of Kommo-o on a team also forces opponents to play more conservatively around Amoonguss, effectively granting the rest of the squad more breathing room.</OUTPUT>"

Rillaboom provides priority Grassy Glide to pick off faster threats that Kommo-o cannot outpace, notably Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane, while Grassy Terrain adds passive recovery that stacks with Leftovers to keep Kommo-o healthy throughout a long game. Ursaluna-Bloodmoon offers a physical breaker that can overwhelm Tera Fairy targets that Kommo-o cannot fully remove, while Kommo-o in return handles Corviknight and Gholdengo for the bear.

Priority users such as Kingambit\u2019s Sucker Punch or Chien-Pao\u2019s Ice Shard can finish off a weakened Kommo-o after it has taken a Moonblast or Icy Wind chip. Status\u2014especially burn from Rotom-W or Gholdengo\u2014removes Kommo-o\u2019s longevity and makes it harder to trigger Throat Spray safely. Finally, phazing moves such as Roar from Ting-Lu or Dondozo can remove Kommo-o\u2019s stat boosts and force it to re-enter on a dangerous field. The simplest counterplay is to deny speed control: if Kommo-o cannot get an Icy Wind or Tailwind up, it fails to outpace base 135 scarfers and becomes relegated to trading one-for-one. Teams that carry dual Fairy pressure\u2014e.g., Choice Specs Sylveon and Tera Fairy Kingambit\u2014can force Kommo-o to Tera to survive the first, then finish it with the second. Lastly, because Kommo-o relies on Throat Spray, Encore users such as Murkrow or opposing Kommo-o can lock it into Protect or Clanging Scales and waste the item window.</OUTPUT>"

In the back, it functions as a late-game win-condition once threats are poisoned and its own partners have removed opposing Steel- and Poison-types. Its low offensive stats mean it rarely secures KOs; instead, it shortens the game clock by forcing 3- and 4-turn poison timers while its own bulky teammates stall with recovery. Weezing\u2019s speed tier is intentionally low to function under Trick Room, where it can poison both foes before they move and deny Reckless boosts from Iron Hands or Ursaluna. Because Neutralizing Gas is always active, Weezing must be played proactively: switching it in at the right moment to negate a Contrary user or erase Triage from Iron Valiant can swing entire matches. The Grass Tera type is not just defensive\u2014turning Weezing\u2019s Gunk Shot neutral into a super-effective hit versus Water- and Ground-types gives it surprise KO potential on threats like Toxapex or Swampert.</OUTPUT>"

The chosen spread (implied to be 252/0/252/0/252/0 with an Eviolite) maximizes both defenses, allowing it to survive a Life Orb Dragonite Tera Flying Extreme Speed or a Choice Band Sneasler Close Combat and keep redirection alive. Vital Spirit is the default ability, blanking Amoonguss and Breloom spores that otherwise plague teams that rely on Rillaboom or Incineroar. Static is a niche alternative that can paralyze contact attackers, but the data show it is used far less. Electroweb is the preferred speed-control move over Thunder Wave because it hits both foes, breaks Focus Sashes, and still procs its own chip damage while slowing the entire opposing board. Taunt is critical in the current meta to stop Trick Room setters like Indeedee-F or Hatterene, and it also prevents opposing Follow Me or Rage Powder users from stealing its own redirection. Protect is self-explanatory on a redirector, letting it dodge double-targets and preserve Eviolite bulk for later turns. Tera Ghost is the most common choice, giving it a Normal- and Fighting-immunity that lets it block Fake Out and Extreme Speed while also turning its Follow Me into a ghostly lightning rod that can\u2019t be phazed by Roar or Dragon Tail; Tera Dragon is the second choice, mainly to resist Water- and Grass-type coverage aimed at its Fire- and Grass-type partners. The synergy with Rillaboom is obvious\u2014Grassy Glide under Electroweb speed control becomes a guaranteed snipe on most neutral targets, while Grassy Terrain chip heals Electabuzz slightly each turn. Incineroar forms a classic intimidate core, dropping Attack so Electabuzz\u2019s bulk goes even further, while Electabuzz redirects potential Electric or Super-Effective moves away from Incineroar. Dragonite appreciates Electroweb slowing opposing Scarfers so it can safely set up Dragon Dance, and Kingambit benefits from redirection while it stacks Supreme Overlord boosts.

The lack of bulk investment is offset by the fact that Talonflame is rarely expected to survive more than two turns; instead it trades itself for board advantage, either by securing Tailwind, burning a key target, or dealing 40-50 % with Brave Bird to frail offensive threats.  Tera Ghost has overtaken Tera Flying in usage because it removes the Ghost weakness, blocks Fake Out, and turns Talonflame into an emergency spin-blocker versus Gholdengo teams, while Tera Grass punishes expected Rock Slide or Kyurem Ice Beam reads and provides a crucial Water resistance for Dondozo cores.  The decline of Flame Body sets shows that players prioritize consistency over the 30 % burn chance, and the absence of bulky EV spreads indicates that the metagame is simply too powerful for Talonflame to invest in bulk and still remain relevant offensively.</OUTPUT>"

The team composition therefore balances offensive synergy (shared Psychic spam, Fire/Water/Grass cores) and defensive synergy (Intimidate, Follow Me, Flash Fire), allowing Armarouge to operate both as a lead and as a mid-game cleaner.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>In the current Regulation-G environment Kilowattrel\u2019s value proposition is straightforward: it is the second-fastest Tailwind setter legal after Talonflame, and the fastest that carries an offensive Electric STAB. Base-125 Speed lets it outrun +1 Roaring Moon, +1 Dragonite, and every unboosted Scarfer short of Barraskewda, guaranteeing Tailwind versus most leads. Once wind is up, 105 SpA Thunderbolt and Air Slash give it reasonable damage into neutral targets\u2014roughly 50 % into bulky Incineroar and 65-75 % into Tera-Fairy Garchomp\u2014while Air Slash\u2019s 30 % flinch chance can steal turns. Competitive turns common Intimidate cores (Incineroar, Landorus-T, Arcanine) into set-up bait, often granting +2 SpA immediately; with +2, Kilowattrel cleanly OHKOs 4-HP Tornadus-T after spread damage and secures the 2HKO on Assault-Vest Gholdengo. Volt Absorb variants punish predicted Regieleki or Iron Hands Volt Switches, regaining ~33 % HP and flipping momentum, but the data show only ~5 % of battlers opt for it, preferring the snowball potential of Competitive. Wind Power is almost unseen; although it boosts the next Electric move after Kilowattrel is hit, the requirement to survive a hit first clashes with its frailty. Tera Ghost is taken on every recorded team: it nullifies Fake Out, blocks Prankster status, and makes Explosion from Gholdengo or Togedemaru free turns. EV spreads are cookie-cutter Timid max-speed/max-Special-Attack with 4 HP or 4 Def to tweak download and Gyro Ball damage; Focus Sash guarantees at least two actions unless Kilowattrel eats multi-hit or Unseen Fist. Offensively, Kilowattrel appreciates chip: Air Slash into Garchomp is only a 3HKO, but after Stealth Rock or a single U-turn it becomes a clean 2HKO. Thunderbolt is the safest button into Corviknight, Toxapex and Pelipper, but fails to OHKO Azumarill or bulked-up Dondozo, so partners must carry strong Grass or Freeze-Dry coverage. Defensively, Kilowattrel folds to any neutral physical hit; Choice Band Dragonite Extreme Speed does 110-130 %, and even resisted Iron Head from Jirachi reaches 70-85 %. Consequently, it is almost never brought to end-game scenarios unless Tailwind is still needed. In best-of-three sets opponents often lead their own Tailwind or priority to deny it, so Kilowattrel teams tend to run dual-speed control\u2014either a second Tailwind (Talonflame) or Icy Wind Porygon2\u2014to ensure the speed advantage. Overall, Kilowattrel is a high-risk, high-reward tempo pick: when it sets up unobstructed it catapults its side ahead, but onemisplay or a surviving Rock-type priority can instantly collapse the game plan.</OUTPUT>"

Against hyper-offense it speed-ties Iron Bundle and outspeeds +1 Roaring Moon, but it cannot survive a hit from Chien-Pao or Choice Band Dragonite, so it must either sash or Terastallize.

Once wind is active, Kilowattrel becomes a mid-tier special attacker: Thunderbolt nails Water- and Flying-types, Air Slash pressures Grass, Fighting and opposing Dragons, and the 30 % flinch chance can steal games.

Garchomp is the star synergy: it underspeeds most threats under neutral conditions but outspeeds everything at +1 or under Tailwind, and it baits Ice moves that Kilowattrel can switch into for a Volt Absorb heal. Incineroar provides Fake Out and Parting Shot to buy Tailwind turns; because Competitive deters opposing Intimidate, both Pok\u00e9mon can coexist without tripping over each other\u2019s stat drops.

Its Fairy typing deters Dragons like Dragapult and Roaring Moon, while Psychic typing lets it hit Poisons like Amoonguss and Toxapex for super-effective damage. Magic Bounce also makes it a soft check to status and hazard setters, though it must be wary of Mold Breaker Excadrill and Tera Dark Kingambit.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Hisuian Arcanine\u2019s claim to fame is the rare Rock/Fire typing coupled with Intimidate, giving it a unique damage profile and the ability to drop opposing Attack stats on entry. Flare Blitz is its strongest reliable STAB, nuking common Steel- and Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Togekiss, and Gholdengo. Rock Slide provides spread damage and flinch chances into Flying, Fire, and Ice foes while synergising with its own Terastallisation options. Extreme Speed is the set\u2019s glue, granting a +2 priority pick-off that punishes weakened sweepers and bypasses opposing speed control. Protect is mandatory doubles tech, letting it scout choice locks, stall out speed control or Dynamon turns, and preserve its respectable 95/80/80 bulk. Tera Water is the most popular choice, removing its 4\u00d7 Fire weakness and turning incoming Water moves into neutral or resisted hits while still allowing STAB Flare Blitz through Tera Blast if desired; Tera Ghost offers spin-blocking utility and an immunity to Fake Out and Extreme Speed from rival Dragons, notably Dragonite. The item data is sparse, but Mirror Herb and Clear Amulet hint at two builds: Herb punishes stat-boosting foes such as Iron Hands or Chien-Pao by copying their boosts, whereas Clear Amulet prevents its own Attack drops from Intimidate or Parting Shot, ensuring damage output remains consistent. Its abilities show overwhelming preference for Intimidate, underscoring its primary role as a physical deterrent, while Rock Head\u2019s low usage reflects the difficulty of capitalising on it without Head Smash or Wild Charge. Overall, Hisuian Arcanine is a momentum machine that compresses speed, power, and disruption into a single slot, demanding respect from both offensive and defensive cores.</OUTPUT>"

Close Combat rounds the coverage, smacking Ferrothorn, Kingambit, and opposing Tauros formes for heavy damage and preventing it from becoming deadweight against Grass- or opposing Water-type cores. Protect is mandatory in doubles to stall out speed control turns, scout choice locks, and leverage Intimidate multiple times. Tera usage is split between Water (\u224828 %) to power up Wave Crash and flip Grass match-ups, and Grass (\u224843 %) to bait opposing Water, Electric, and Grass moves while removing the Electric weakness and giving it a better lane versus Amoonguss and Rillaboom.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Hydreigon\u2019s main draw is the combination of high special attack, workable speed tier and Levitate, which together let it act as both a breaker and a pivot. Draco Meteor is still the strongest spammable Dragon move in the tier; after a drop it still 2HKOes most neutral targets and cleanly OHKOes frailer offensive Pok\u00e9mon such as Chi-Yu, Iron Moth and opposing Hydreigon. Dark Pulse provides perfect neutral coverage alongside Draco, flinches and breaks Psychic Terrain, and is crucial for hitting Aegislash, Gholdengo and Indeedee-F for super-effective damage. Snarl is what pushes Hydreigon from a simple attacker into a support pivot: dropping both opponents\u2019 special attack by one stage turns many 2HKOs into 3HKOs, protects frail partners such as Sneasler from taking lethal special hits, and gives the team pseudo-\u201cintimidate\u201d versus special attackers. Protect is mandatory doubles glue, letting it scout choice locks, stall out Tailwind or Trick Room turns, and recover a little health with Leftovers-style items. Safety Goggles is the most common item because Amoonguss is on roughly every third team: ignoring Rage Powder and Spore means Hydreigon can click Draco or Snarl into the mushroom without fear, forcing the opponent to either double-target the dragon or risk losing their redirector. Life Orb is still popular for the immediate power it adds, turning many 2HKOs into OHKOs (notably OHKOing 0 HP Gholdengo with Dark Pulse after rocks). Covert Cloak is a tech that has risen in usage alongside the popularity of Snarl Mirror matches, Icy Wind spam and Fake Tears: by ignoring secondary effects it essentially gives Hydreigon a free pass to ignore speed control and special drops, letting it keep its offensive pressure throughout longer games. Tera Ghost is the most common because it removes the only 4\u00d7 weakness (Fighting) and turns the dragon into a spinblocker that also dodes Extreme Speed from Dragonite and opposing Ursaluna. Tera Fire is the second most common, flipping the Fairy and Ice match-ups and roasting Kingambit, Corviknight and Gholdengo on the switch. Timid 252/252 is the only relevant EV spread: it outspeeds Jolly Chien-Pao, scarf Garchomp and Modest Iron Moth while guaranteeing the OHKO on 0 HP Gholdengo with Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock. No bulk investment is run because the dragon\u2019s bulk is merely average and its role is to hit first and hit hard; any bulk investment causes it to miss key KOs and speed-ties it cannot afford to lose.</OUTPUT>"

Aura Sphere gives perfect neutral coverage alongside Fire, nailing Heatran, Kingambit and Tyranitar while ignoring Wide Guard. Coaching is the surprise tech that turns Blaziken into a dual-role piece: after a Protect speed boost it can click Coaching on the predicted switch, instantly granting +1 Atk/+1 Def to partners such as Rillaboom or Kingambit, enabling them to pick up KOs they otherwise could not (e.g., +1 Kingambit Sucker Punch OHKOes 252 HP 4 Def Indeedee-F). Focus Sash is mandatory because 80/80 physical bulk and 70 special bulk mean any neutral STAB or super-effective hit breaks it; nevertheless, Sash guarantees at least one Speed Boost cycle and prevents priority revenge kills from Shadow Sneak, Aqua Jet or Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost is the third-most common option, letting Blaziken block Fake Out, Extreme Speed and Shadow Sneak while maintaining offensive Fire-type power, whereas Tera Stellar is taken for pure neutral coverage and the 1.2\u00d7 boost to both STABs when Coaching is not needed.

Overgrow, the ability picked two-thirds of the time, is a safety net that boosts Grass power when HP falls below a third, occasionally clinching KOs with Flower Trick when Protean has already been burned. The terrain-agnostic nature of its moves means it performs equally under Psychic Terrain, Grassy Terrain, or in Trick Room (though it hates the latter).

The two showcased EV spreads highlight two philosophies: 252/4/252 maximises special bulk while still avoiding 2HKOs from key special attackers, whereas 244/188/76 hits a jump point in defence, guaranteeing survival against Life Orb Earthquake from Great Tusk and allowing Dusclops to stay on the field longer to click support moves. Tera Grass is preferred to remove the water weakness and tank Surfs from partners, but Tera Dark is rising in usage to dodge Rage Fist boosts from Annihilape and gain a crucial Ghost/Dark defensive profile versus opposing ghost types.

Stall and bulky Tail-Room squads can overwhelm it with Taunt users like Murkrow or status spreaders such as Amoonguss, but even then Dusclops can Tera out of Spore vulnerability and click Pain Split to stay healthy. Sun and Rain can dent it with boosted Surfs and Overheats, yet Tera Grass patches the water weakness and sun-boosted Heat Wave from Torkoal is a common partner move that opponents must respect.

Its ghost typing lets it block Rapid Spin and ignore Fake Out, making it the premier partner for slow, hard-hitting titans that despise flinches. Offensively it contributes fixed 100 HP chunks via Night Shade and uses Pain Split to punish high-HP walls like Dondozo and Toxapex, turning its own lower HP into a resource. Max special bulk is favoured because most physical attackers fear Will-O-Wisp, but the physically defensive spread exists specifically to check Great Tusk, Kingambit and opposing Ursaluna under room. Tera is used reactively: Grass to flip water match-ups, Dark to dodge Rage Fist and ghost-targeting moves, and occasionally Normal to become immune to ghost attacks that threaten its slot.

Torkoal provides sun-removed Eruption spam and removes water weakness for Dusclops with Tera Grass; in return Dusclops beats water absorb Gastrodon and Toxapex that trouble sun. Tyranitar offers a sand backbone, special bulk, and lures fighting moves that Dusclops can switch into; Will-O-Wisp neutles Iron Hands and Lucario that trouble TTar. Sneasler appreciates room for Dire Claw shenanigans and can beat Taunt users with Unburden pops, while Annihilape shares ghost/dark resists, stacks Rage Fist, and forms an impenetrable burn core with Dusclops. These cores are so standard that opponents often lead Taunt + dark type to stop room, meaning Dusclops itself needs ally redirection (Indeedee-F) or follow-me users like Togekiss to guarantee room versus anti-room techs.

Critical hits bypass bulk investment and happen more than you expect; a crit Crunch or Knock Off usually spells the end. Status in general cripples it: Toxic from Amoonguss or Toxapex puts it on a timer, and without leftovers Pain Split can only stall so long. Opposing ghost types like Aegislash and opposing Dusclops can turn room into a coin flip, and if they carry Imprison they block Trick Room entirely. Finally, multi-hit moves such as Population Bomb from Maushold or Baxcalibur Icicle Crash through potential Rocky Helmet chip can KO before Pain Split recovers.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Garganacl\u2019s niche is unrivaled: it is the only Rock-type with access to both Recover and a passive damage move that ignores Protect. Salt Cure\u2019s 1/8 max-HP drain against non-Steel targets is effectively a guaranteed KO timer\u2014after two hits most offensive Pok\u00e9mon are in range of any follow-up attack. Purifying Salt\u2019s status immunity removes the traditional Rock-type fear of Scald burns or Spore, while the 50% damage reduction from Ghost and Dragon attacks lets it hard-wall Flutter Mane, specs Dragapult, and even boosted Baxcalibur. The chosen EV spreads illustrate two philosophies: the 252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD Careful spread reaches 211/169/200 bulk, surviving Modest Life-Orb Gholdengo Make-It-Rain plus Follow-Me chip, while the 196/76 variant shifts 20 EVs into Defense to guarantee surviving Jolly Chien-Pao Icicle Crash into Sacred Sword. Wide Guard is the secret sauce: it blanks Flutter Mane\u2019s Dazzling Gleam, Kingambit\u2019s Behemoth Blade, and both versions of Landorus\u2019s Earth Power, giving teammates free turns to set up or retaliate. Recover + Protect lets Garganacl win 1v1 endgames against most non-boosted attackers, and because Salt Cure hits through Protect, it punishes passive play. Tera choices are reactive: Flying removes its Ground weakness and allows it to switch into Great Tusk Headlong Rush or Landorus-T Earthquake, while Tera Poison flips the Fighting weakness into a resistance and neutralizes Rillaboom\u2019s Grassy Glide. Water (15%) is a middle-ground that keeps neutrality to Ground but adds a crucial resistance to Fire, useful versus Heatran and Sun teams. The dominance of berry items\u2014Maranga raises SpD after taking a special hit, Leftoids provide constant recovery\u2014means Garganacl is never dead weight even if ignored, because every turn it stays on field the Salt Cure clock ticks. Opponents must either double-target it (risking Wide Guard), over-kill with super-effective moves, or remove it with raw power before it gets two Salt Cures off. Garganacl therefore dictates tempo: it forces switches, reveals Tera types early, and depletes opposing Dynamons while your own sweepers set up behind Wide Guard.</OUTPUT>"

Under sand, Sand Rush doubles its Speed to an astronomical level, allowing it to outpace even +1 Roaring Moon and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. This enables a straightforward game plan: lead Lycanroc + Tyranitar, set sand, and fire off fast Rock Slides that fish for 30 % flinches while dealing solid damage to common threats like Togekiss, Talonflame, and Murkrow. Close Combat hits Steel- and Normal-types such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Snorlax for super-effective damage, while Psychic Fangs shatters Reflect and Light Screen\u2014two omnipresent tools in the current doubles format\u2014and punnshes Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Iron Hands. The Focus Sash guarantees that Lycanroc survives at least one hit, patching its mediocre bulk and letting it retaliate or set up a Tera. Tera Ghost is the more common option, removing its Fighting weakness and granting immunity to Fake Out, Mach Punch, and Extreme Speed, thereby allowing it to serve as a soft check to priority-reliant teams. Tera Fighting, on the other hand, turns Close Combat into a 180-base-power nuke that cleanly OHKOes max-HP Corviknight and 2HKOes physically defensive Dondozo. EV spreads are simple: 252 Atk / 252 Spe Adamant maximizes damage and guarantees the speed tie against other Sand Rush sweepers, while the remaining 4 EVs are placed in SpD to download a potential Download boost from opposing Iron Bundle. Despite these strengths, Lycanroc is frail, requires sand to function, and is shut down by intimidate, burn, and priority that bypasses Sash such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit. It also struggles into bulky Water- and Grass-types like Rotom-Wash, Amoonguss, and Sinistcha, which can survive a hit and KO back.</OUTPUT>"

The displayed Calm nature with 252 HP / 60 Def / 76 SpD / 116 Spe hits key benchmarks: it survives +1 252-Atk Dragonite Tera Flying Tera Blast, outspeeds neutral-nature base 70 threats like Breloom and Bisharp, and avoids the 2HKO from most common Grass Knot users. Leftovers and Sitrus Berry are equally viable items; Leftovers offsets chip from Stealth Rock and Incineroar U-turns, while Situs Berry allows a one-time recovery burst that can swing end-game Perish turns. Mystic Water is a niche offensive option that turns Weather Ball into a deceptively strong nuke under rain, 2HKOing even Toxapex and Rotom-Wash after minor chip. Tera Grass is overwhelmingly preferred (67% usage) because it removes the Electric weakness, neutralizes Grass-type moves aimed at Politoed, and flips the Kingdra mirror by resisting both STABs. Tera Fire is a secondary option that punits Ferroseed and Amoonguss, but it leaves Politoed vulnerable to Thunder Wave and Volt Switch. Perish Song is the set\u2019s win-condition: after three turns both active opponents are KO\u2019d unless they switch, and Gothitelle\u2019s Shadow Tag or Archaludon\u2019s Anchor Shot can prevent escape. Encore locks support Pok\u00e9mon like Amoonguss, Murkrow, or Dondozo into harmless moves, creating free turns for Kingdra or Basculegion to set up or nuke. Protect is mandatory for Perish stalling and scouting Choice items. The 0% usage of Water Absorb and Damp indicates that Drizzle is non-negotiable; losing the auto-weather removes Politoed\u2019s only real reason to be used over Alomomola or Tapu Fini.</OUTPUT>"

Double-Edge is the strongest reliable STAB, but the recoil plus Life Orb means Slaking is on a timer; Sucker Punch punishes faster threats trying to exploit the loaf turn, and Knock Off cripples common switch-ins like Aegislash, Corviknight, and opposing Dondozo.

Sun teams are a mixed bag: Torkoal\u2019s Eruption is scary, but if Toedscruel survives the first hit it can Spore the setter and buy two free turns. Against Rain, Water-tera gives it a crucial resistance to Fire, but the lack of recovery means repeated Hydro Pumps still wear it down. In the mirror, speed ties decide everything; the analyzed cohort shows almost every Toedscruel is Timid max-speed, so winning the coin-flip is paramount.</OUTPUT>"

The transformation activates the moment it switches out, meaning the first Flip Turn or ally-initiated pivot instantly upgrades it into a 160 Atk monster. Offensively, Hero Form Palafin out-muscles Koraidon, Groudon and most restricted box legends, yet is legal in Series 2 because its base form is a humble 100/100/97/97/97/100 stat line. This stat jump gives it the highest unboosted Attack in the format, letting Mystic Water Jet Punch OHKO 4 HP Chi-Yu and 2HKO max-invested Incineroar. Choice Band turns Wave Crash into a 180 BP nuke that 2HKOs Dondozo and nearly OHKOs Assault Vest Archaludon after Tera Water. Its Speed tier is simultaneously a blessing and a curse: base 100 ties Gholdengo, Lilligant-Hisui and opposing Palafin, but a 236 EV spread with Adamant and Scarf lets it outrun +1 Dragonite, Chien-Pao and Timid Iron Valiant. Defensively, 100/97/97 bulk plus neutrality to Fake Out, Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch means Palafin can stomach one hit, retaliate, and pivot out to reset Hero Form. The only real drawback is its predictability: it almost always clicks Jet Punch or Flip Turn, so smart opponents can set Protect cycles or Wide Guard to blunt its momentum. Nonetheless, its raw numbers, priority and pivoting make it the glue that holds many balance and offense teams together.</OUTPUT>"

Tera Grass variants of Dragapult, Kingambit and even Gholdengo lure and beat Palafin one-on-one. Rillaboom under Grassy Terrain is a hard stop unless Palafin carries Ice Spinner and has prior chip. Electric Terrain Iron Hands lives Jet Punch and OHKOs with Thunder Punch, while Iron Thorns does the same with Quake. Wide Guard users such as Swampert, Garganacl and Skeledirge completely shut down Wave Crash and Close Combat, forcing awkward Jet Punch cycles.

Ice Spinner is preferred over Icicle Crash for its perfect accuracy and its ability to remove Psychic Terrain and grassy terrain on the switch, neutering Indeedee/Armarouge redirection and weakening opposing Grassy Glide or Horn Leech recovery.  Knock Off is the second most spammable move in doubles and lets Weavile cripple common switch-ins such as Corviknight, Tornadus, and opposing Sashed leads.  Ice Shard gives the team a much-needed priority option that cleanly picks off weakened Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and opposing Weavile.  Protect is mandatory for double-target mind-games and to guarantee the Focus Sash is not broken before Weavile can act.  Terastallizing into Ghost is the consensus best choice: it flips the script on Fighting-type counters, blocks Extreme Speed and Mach Punch, and grants a crucial Fake Out immunity that lets Weavile protect its partner or secure a second attack.  Pressure is the default ability because Pickpocket is too inconsistent in doubles, but the difference is marginal.  EV spreads are almost always 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe Jolly to maximize damage and speed while the remaining 4 EVs are dumped into HP; the Focus Sash guarantees at least one full-power attack or a safe Tailwind/Parting Shot from a teammate.  Weavile\u2019s offensive typing is simultaneously its greatest strength and its Achilles heel: Ice/Dark is unresisted against the majority of the tier, but it also leaves Weavile weak to every common form of priority and every relevant spread move.  Consequently, Weavile is almost never the win-condition itself; instead it functions as a high-tempo pivot that trades one-for-one or removes items so that bulkier teammates such as Ursaluna-Bloodmoon, Archaludon, or Annihililape can sweep later.</OUTPUT>"

Double Shock is the headline move\u2014an Electric-type Explosion that removes the user\u2019s Electric typing after use. This self-typing removal is double-edged: on the one hand it robs Pawmot of STAB, but on the other it turns incoming Electric or Ground moves neutral, letting you dodge predicted T-bolts or Earthquakes after the nuke. Close Combat provides perfect neutral coverage alongside Double Shock, smashing Steels that resist Electric and Stealth Rock setters like Gholdengo. Fake Out is invaluable for speed control and free chip, while Protect preserves Focus Sash and lets Pawmot wait out Tailwind turns. Natural Cure is the most used ability because status\u2014especially Twave from Rotom or WoW from Arcanine\u2014otherwise cripples its sweep; a single switch cures it. Volt Absorb is situationally better on teams that bait opposing Electric moves, turning Pawmot into a soft check to Zapdos or Iron Hands. Iron Fist is niche but technically boosts Drain Punch (which the data do not show) or Thunder Punch; the usage implies players value the raw power of Double Shock over marginal fist boosts.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Gardevoir\u2019s offensive typing is simultaneously its greatest strength and its most exploitable weakness. Fairy/Psychic is historically awkward: resisted by Steel and other Psychics, yet unresisted by Dragon, Dark, and Fighting cores that populate the metagame. The data show Gardevoir running four attacks and a Choice Scarf, underscoring a philosophy of \u2018kill something immediately or pivot out\u2019. Mystical Fire is the glue that holds the set together, 2HKOing common Steel-type switches such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Kingambit while dropping their Attack stat. Dazzling Gleam is the go-to spread move, punishing Dragon- and Dark-type duos and preserving damage when the opponent fields two targets. Moonblast is the single-target nuke, offering a 30 % chance to drop Special Attack and giving Gardevoir a reliable finishing move that doesn\u2019t rely on positioning. Expanding Force is the most interesting inclusion: under Psychic Terrain it becomes a 120-base-power spread move that cleanly OHKOs neutral targets such as Rotom-Wash, Amoonguss, and opposing Indeedee-F, turning Gardevoir into a legitimate terrain sweeper. The Choice Scarf guarantees it outpaces the unboosted metagame, letting it revenge kill threats like +1 Dragonite, Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and opposing Choice-locked attackers. Telepathy is the optimal ability because Gardevoir is almost always paired with Indeedee-F or Incineroar; both allies spam spread moves, and Telepathy prevents the self-inflicted chip that would otherwise cripple Gardevoir over a long game. EV spreads are straightforward: Modest nature maximises damage, 252 Speed with Scarf hits 364, outspeeding everything up to +1 base 100s, and 4 EVs are dropped into Special Defence to survive a modest roll from Specs Dragapult Shadow Ball. Tera Fairy is preferred when the team needs a Dragon immunity and a stronger Fairy STAB to muscle past bulky Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu; Tera Psychic is chosen when the squad is built around Psychic Terrain and Gardevoir is expected to nuke entire teams with Expanding Force. In practice the two Tera types are interchangeable depending on the rest of the roster, but the data tilt slightly toward Psychic because Expanding Force\u2019s raw power is the biggest differentiator Gardevoir brings to the table compared to other Fairy-type special attackers like Sylveon or Scream Tail.</OUTPUT>"

Steel-type cores are the primary roadblock; without Mystical Fire Gardevoir fails to break Corviknight, Gholdengo, or Tinkaton, and even with the fire coverage it must predict correctly because a misprediction leaves it locked into an ineffective move. Psychic-type mirrors are awkward because opposing Indeedee-F sets Terrain first, nullifying Gardevoir\u2019s Expanding Force boost and forcing it to rely on Moonblast. Ghost-types such as Aegislash and bulky Gholdengo can stomach a Mystical Fire and retalify with powerful Steel-type or Ghost-type moves. Priority users\u2014especially Shadow Sneak Aegislash and Sucker Punch Kingambit\u2014can finish off a chipped Gardevoir before it moves, so maintaining healthy HP is crucial. Finally, Tailwind or Chlorophyll sweepers that can outspeed even Scarf Gardevoir (such as Tailwind Zapdos or Sun-based Venusaur) force the player to either Tera Fairy for bulk or switch out and reset positioning.

U-turn guarantees that Scizor can retain offensive tempo, generating favorable switch-ins for teammates such as Ursaluna-Bloodmoon or Annihilape that appreciate softened checks. Close Combat covers the Steel-resistant Dark and Normal types that otherwise wall its STAB, notably 2HKOing max HP Kingambit through Protect while guaranteeing the KO on standard Incineroar. Knock Off rounds the set by removing critical items\u2014Leftovers from Dondozo, Sitrus from support Togekiss, or opposing Bands\u2014crippling would-be counters for the remainder of the match. Tera Fire is the linchpin of the set: it flips the Fire-type matchup, letting Scizor survive Heat Wave from Torkoal or a Sun-boosted Eruption and retaliate, while simultaneously removing its Ice-type weakness, allowing it to live Blizzard from Kyurem or Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao. Psychic Tera represents a smaller but notable cohort that instead aims to tank Fighting-type moves from Annihilape and Iron Valiant while still resisting Bullet Punch mirror exchanges.

Stellar Tera removes Shadow Ball\u2019s immunities and resistances, meaning Gengar no longer needs prediction to break Normal- or Dark-types; it simply clicks Shadow Ball for neutral damage and often a KO after Tera. Cursed Body is a low-roll but high-impact ability: disabling a Sacred Sword from Annihilape or a Sucker Punch from Kingambit can swing entire games. The chosen moveset is lean and effective: Shadow Ball is the primary STAB, Sludge Bomb nails opposing Fairies and Grass-types, Icy Wind provides both chip damage and a one-stage speed debuff that allows slower teammates to move first next turn, and Protect is mandatory in doubles to stall Fake Out, dodge Zacian\u2019s Behemoth Blade, or preserve the Focus Sash for a second turn. EV spreads are straightforward: 252 Speed and 252 Special Attack maximize offenses, with the last 4 HP or Defense to slightly optimize bulk; either spread achieves the same key stat breakpoints, so the choice is largely cosmetic. Tera Dark is an occasional alternative to Stellar, granting an immunity to opposing Shadow Balls and Prankster status, but the sheer versatility of ignoring resistances keeps Stellar firmly in the lead.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Chandelure\u2019s stat line and movepool push it toward a hybrid role: it is simultaneously the fastest viable Trick Room setter (base 80) and one of the strongest special attackers available in Regulation D.  Heat Wave and Shadow Ball give perfect neutral coverage against the tier\u2019s premier Fairy, Steel, and Psychic tanks, while Trick Room flips the tempo versus hyper-offensive archetypes built around Dragapult, Iron Valiant, or Choice Scarf Gholdengo.  The Quiet 252/140/116 spread survives Jolly Chien-Pao Crunch 100 % of the time and guarantees Trick Room against Timid Iron Bundle outside of Tailwind.  Modest 252 Speed with 132/4/116/4 is an off-speed variant designed to outrun neutral-nature base 70s (e.g., Breloom, Bisharp) under Tailwind while still maximizing power.  Choice Specs turns Chandelure into an immediate nuke, 2HKOing even bulky Tera-Water Arcanine with Heat Wave, whereas Life Orb grants the freedom to switch moves and bluff sets.  Grass Tera is not merely defensive: after Terastallizing, Chandelure avoids the 2HKO from standard Rotom-Wash Hydro Pump and OHKOes back with Overheat, creating a devastating mid-game pivoting opportunity.  Infiltrator invalidates Skeledirge\u2019s Torch Song substitutes and screens stacks, giving Chandelure unique utility versus stall and semi-stall.  The combination of Ghost neutrality to Fighting and Fire neutrality to Fairy means Chandelure can safely switch into Great Tusk and Azumarill once, making it one of the few setters that does not require a dedicated pivot to enter the field.  However, its dependence on accuracy (Heat Wave 90 %, Shadow Ball 100 %) and vulnerability to Sucker Punch, First Impression, and Aqua Jet require careful positioning and often a Protect slot, limiting it to four-move-slot syndrome and forcing teams to dedicate a slot to hazard removal or dual-screen support.</OUTPUT>"

Against balance, Trick Room invalidates common Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and Gholdengo, while Specs Heat Wave pressures Corviknight and Toxapex alike.  Grass Tera single-handedly flips the Rotom-Wash, Pelipper, and Swampert match-ups from losing to favorable, although it must Terastallize early to do so.  Stall teams that rely on Substitute + Protect cycles (Skeledirge, Gliscor) are broken by Infiltrator Shadow Ball, but Chandelure still dislikes Toxic and passive burn, so cleric support from Ribombee (Pollen Puff + Speed Swap) or Dragonite (Heal Bell) is common.  Rain teams present the worst overall scenario: Choice Specs Hurricane from Pelipter cleanly OHKOes even bulky spreads, and Swift Swim Barraskewda outspeeds and KOes before Trick Room can be set.  Consequently, most Chandelure teams pack Rillaboom to pressure Pelipper with Glide and to provide Grassy Terrain chip to offset Rain-boosted Surfs.  Sun is more manageable because Chandelure underspeeds Torkoal and can reverse the field speed, but Tera Fire Eruption still deals 70\u201380 % and requires Protect prediction.  In mirror Trick Room games, Chandelure\u2019s speed tier becomes a liability because opposing Hatterene and Indeedee-F can set terrain and Room first; Ribombee\u2019s Speed Swap or Fake Out support is therefore mandatory.</OUTPUT>"

Unlike Hatterene, it does not supply its own terrain, but its higher Speed and access to Protect let it function as a lead or back-line cleaner depending on the opponent\u2019s structure.  Offensively, it targets the tier\u2019s most common defensive cores: Corviknight + Gholdengo, Toxapex + Kingambit, and Amoonguss + Iron Hands.  Specs Heat Wave + Shadow Ball is only shy of the OHKO on max-HP Gholdengo, but after Stealth Rock or one round of Life Orb chip the KO is guaranteed.  On the defensive side, Chandelure\u2019s Ghost typing grants an immunity to Fake Out and Rapid Spin, making it an ideal blocker versus Great Tusk and Iron Treads that attempt to clear hazards.  Its Fire typing also punishes U-turn from Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Flame Body procs, indirectly preserving Trick Room turns for slower partners.  Because it underspeeds base 85s, Chandelure can serve as a \u201cslow\u201d mode attacker even when Trick Room is not active, picking off weakened threats with Shadow Ball or spreading Burns with Will-O-Wisp (though Will-O-Wisp is rare in current usage).

Ribombee also supplies Pollen Puff healing and Sticky Web, the latter enabling Chandelure to underspeed neutral-nature base 70s without Quiet.  Ursaluna-Bloodmoon is the premier Trick Room abuser: it appreciates Ghost/Fire coverage luring in and weakening Corviknight and Skarmory, while Chandelure appreciates Bloodmoon\u2019s ability to break past special walls like Blissey and Clodsire.

Trick Room is the final piece, letting Malamar function as both abuser and setter: it underspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, so moving first under its own Room turns Superpower into a 120 BP STAB that simultaneously raises its two most important stats. The chosen Tera types reinforce two distinct gameplans: Steel removes the pesky Fairy weakness, adds a Flash Fire-style neutrality to Heat Wave, and provides a crucial Toxic immunity, whereas Water punishes Sun teams by flipping the Fire matchup and granting a handy resistance to common spread moves like Heat Wave and Rock Slide. Safety Goggles is the most popular item because it guarantees Malamar can set up on Amoonguss or rage-powder users, while Leftovers offers slow, incremental recovery that synergizes with the Defense boosts. The 252/252/4 spread maximizes immediate damage output and bulk, ensuring OHKOs on frailer threats like Flutter Mane or Chi-Yu after a single boost while surviving -1 neutral attacks such as Dragon Pulse from bulky Dialga.

Modest Life Orb is the only spread shown, maximizing Special Attack and Speed to guarantee KOs on common threats such as 4 HP Tornadus, offensive Landorus-T, and non-Dynamax Rotom-W after Stealth Rock or a single Helping Hand boost. Draco Meteor is the nuke that breaks through bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss after chip, while Muddy Water provides spread damage with a 30% accuracy debuff that can swing follow-up turns. Weather Ball becomes a 100 BP Water move under rain, giving Kingdra a single-target nuke that bypasses the spread damage reduction and OHKOes threats such as Incineroar and Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock. Protect is mandatory for doubles, allowing Kingdra to dodge Fake Out, buy rain turns, and enable its partner to eliminate counters. Tera Stellar is preferred because it removes the Dragon-typing\u2019s Fairy and Ice weaknesses for the turn, neutralizes Draco Meteor\u2019s Special Attack drop, and turns Tera Blast into a 120 BP move that hits neutrally across the board, letting Kingdra clean late-game even after it has dropped its main nuke. Tera Water is an alternative that boosts Muddy Water and Weather Ball to absurd levels, securing OHKOs on max HP Gastrodon and Assault Vest Slowking, but it leaves Kingdra vulnerable to the same Ice- and Fairy-type moves it hoped to dodge. The usage data shows virtually no deviation from the Modest 252/252 spread, indicating that speed-tieing opposing Kingdra and other Swift Swim sweepers is paramount, and the power drop from Timid is noticeable in key damage rolls.</OUTPUT>"

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Umbreon's base stats translate to 95/110/130 bulk, meaning that even uninvested it survives powerful Z-moves and max-dynamax attacks. The chosen spreads reflect two philosophies: Calm 252/0/100/0/156/0 maximises special bulk to stomach Flutter Mane Moonblasts and Iron Bundle Hydro Pumps, while Bold 252/0/252/0/4/0 shores up the defense side to live Choice Band Chien-Pao Icicle Crash. A hybrid Bold 252/0/132/4/84/36 creeps four Speed to out-slow opposing support Torkoal and Amoonguss, letting Umbreon fire a Taunt or Yawn before they move. FoulPlay is the cornerstone attack: it scales off the target's Attack stat, letting Umbreon punish physical set-up sweepers like Kingambit and Dragonite without investing EVs in its own offenses. Snarl provides immediate special damage reduction, turning 2HKOs into 3HKOs against partners such as Chi-Yu and Iron Moth. Yawn forces switches or secures sleep, creating free turns for partners such as Archaludon to set up Electro Shot or for Pelipper to re-set rain. Taunt shuts down Trick Room, Tailwind, and opposing recovery, making Umbreon a universal answer to stall and speed control archetypes. Item-wise, Sitrus Berry is the most common (0.62%), giving 25% recovery that in tandem with Protect and Leftovers-like residual healing lets Umbreon stick on the field for 8-10 turns; Safety Goggles (0.25%) is a tech to ignore Rage Powder and Spore, particularly useful when paired with its own Amoonguss or when facing Venusaur. Tera Ghost is the most popular choice (24.6%), removing Normal- and Fighting-type weaknesses and granting an immunity to Fake Out and Extreme Speed, while Tera Flying and Tera Water respectively grant Ground immunity and a Rain-boosted Water resistance, synergising with Pelipper rain teams. In dynamax formats, Umbreon rarely maxes itself but can use Max Darkness to drop both opponents' SpD, amplifying teammates' special damage output.</OUTPUT>"

Electroweb is the centerpiece: a spread move that simultaneously damages and lowers Speed, letting slower breakers such as Baxcalibur or Annihilape move before would-be threats like Iron Valiant or opposing weather sweepers. Bullet Seed provides a multi-hit attack that breaks Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute while also dealing solid damage to bulky Waters and Gastrodon; Loaded Dice is occasionally slotted to raise the hit rate to five, though Focus Sash is still the preferred item to guarantee at least one disruption turn versus faster Fake Out leads. Taunt shuts down Trick Room, Tailwind, Grimmsnarl screens, and Amoongus spores, while Protect is mandatory for double-target mind-games and Aftermath activation. Aftermath itself is deceptely potent: many players will target Electrode with a physical move expecting an easy KO, only to lose 25 % of their health and jeopardize end-game calcs. The EV spreads are straightforward: max Speed Timid is non-negotiable; the remaining EVs are typically invested in bulk (236 HP / 4 Def / 4 SpD) to survive Jolly Chien-Pao Ice Spinner or Specs Dragapult Shadow Ball, though some opt for 12 SpA to ensure Bullet Seed always 2HKOes 252/0 Gastrodon through Sitrus.

Jolly 252/252 is the most popular spread (\u224852 %), letting it outspeed positive-nature base 110s such as Garchomp and Meowscarada, while Adamant 252/252 (\u224823 %) trades that speed for immediate wall-breaking power. Close Combat is mandatory: a STAB 120 BP move coming off base 115 Attack is a guaranteed OHKO on most neutral targets that don\u2019t resist it. Extreme Speed provides invaluable +2 priority, cleaning weakened boards and punishing opposing speed control. Meteor Mash offers a 90 BP Steel move that nails Fairies such as Sylveon and Hatterene while giving a 20 % chance to boost Attack, further snowballing games. Inner Focus is taken on virtually every set because flinches are the easiest way to waste its sash; Steadfast and Justified are fringe options that rarely outperform it.

        "output": "<OUTPUT>Although base 80 Speed and a mediocre special movepool leave it outclassed on paper, Braviary-Hisui\u2019s unique combination of Tinted Lens, Psychic-typing and access to Expanding Force allows it to function as a terrain-based wallbreaker that ignores the usual Flying-, Steel- and Dark-type resists that plague Psychic attackers.  Life Orb is the preferred item: the 30 % recoil is offset by the raw power boost it provides to neutral Expanding Force, which effectively hits every non-immune target for at least neutral damage.  Twisted Spoon is a lower-damage, no-recoil alternative that still secures key OHKOs under terrain, while Choice Scarf turns Braviary into a surprise speed-control option that outspeeds +1 Kingambit and Chien-Pao.  The Quiet nature spread (100/156/0/252/0/0) is the most common, maximizing special attack while letting Braviary underspeed its own Indeedee-F so terrain is already active when it attacks; Timid variants trade immediate power for the ability to outspeed base 100 threats such as Garchomp and Chien-Pao.  Tera Psychic is essentially mandatory, pushing Expanding Force to a 156 BP spread move after STAB and terrain, and giving Braviary a one-time nuke that can erase bulky resists like Corviknight and Aegislash.  Protect is kept on every set to allow positioning around Fake Out and to let speed-controlling partners such as Poliwrath or Pelipper set rain or swap in safely.  Esper Wing is the preferred coverage, offering a 100 % crit chance in Tailwind or versus burned targets and rounding out the set with a reliable single-target option.</OUTPUT>"

Incineroar is the classic pivot: Intimidate and Parting Shot create setup chances, and Mamoswine punishes the Fire-types that roast Incineroar. Garganacl shores up the matchup into Fairy and Water teams by soaking Moonblast and Surf, while Mamoswine removes opposing Steel-types that block Salt Cure.
